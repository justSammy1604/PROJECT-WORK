### Relative Strength Index (RSI)
The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between 0 and 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market.
- **Formula**:
  RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
  where RS = Average Gain over X periods / Average Loss over X periods
- **Common Settings**: 14 periods
- **Overbought**: RSI > 70
- **Oversold**: RSI < 30
- **Use Case**: Helps traders decide entry and exit points based on momentum.

# Financial Market Types 

Financial markets can be broadly classified by the instruments traded and the time horizon. **Money markets** deal in short-term debt instruments (maturities typically <1 year). These include Treasury bills, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and overnight lending markets. Money markets provide liquidity and short-term funding to governments, banks, and corporations. In contrast, **capital markets** handle longer-term securities (maturities >1 year), such as stocks and bonds. Capital ma...

Other major market types include: 

- **Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market**: The global OTC market for trading currencies. It is the largest financial market (around $6–8 trillion traded daily). It operates 24 hours and allows participants (banks, funds, corporations, governments) to exchange one currency for another. Forex markets are used for international trade, speculation, and hedging currency risk.  
- **Derivatives Markets**: Markets for instruments whose value derives from underlying assets (stocks, bonds, commodities, indices, currencies). Common derivatives include futures, options, forwards and swaps. These trade on exchanges (e.g. CME, CBOE) or OTC (for customized contracts). Derivative markets allow risk management (hedging) and leverage.  
- **Commodity Markets**: Physical or electronic marketplaces for raw materials (hard commodities like oil, gold; soft commodities like wheat, coffee). They include spot and futures contracts (e.g. NYMEX oil futures). Commodity markets enable producers and consumers to hedge price risk and provide speculation opportunities.  
- **Equity Markets**: Stock exchanges where corporate equity shares are listed and traded (e.g. NYSE, NASDAQ). Equity markets provide liquidity for investors and price discovery for companies’ value.  
- **Bond Markets**: Markets for debt securities (government, municipal, corporate). They can be primary issuances or secondary trading (often OTC). Bond markets price credit risk and interest rate risk for issuers and investors.  

Each market has its own conventions, hours, and regulatory framework. For example, government bond markets are highly liquid with auctions (primary) and dealer networks (secondary), whereas equity markets use central limit order books on exchanges. In all cases, *primary markets* facilitate raising capital (new issues), while *secondary markets* provide liquidity and price discovery for existing securities. 

**Examples:** US Treasury market (money market and capital market depending on T-bill vs long bond), S&P 500 stock market (capital market equities), CME oil futures market (commodity/derivative), forex market for EUR/USD (FX).  

## Risk and Return Metrics 

A core concept in finance is quantifying expected return and the risk of an investment. **Expected return** is the probability-weighted average of possible outcomes. Mathematically, if an asset can yield returns R_i with probability p_i, then its expected return is 
E[R] = ∑ p_i R_i. 
In practice, one may estimate E[R] using historical average returns or forward-looking models (e.g. CAPM, factor models). A common decomposition of returns splits them into *risk-free rate* (time value of money) and *risk premium*.  

**Risk** is often measured by volatility (standard deviation of returns). The variance σ^2 of returns measures dispersion: 
σ^2 = ∑ p_i (R_i - E[R])^2, σ = sqrt(σ^2). 
Higher σ means greater uncertainty of returns. In portfolio context, co-movement is captured by covariance or correlation matrices.  

Key risk–adjusted return metrics include:  
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Measures excess return per unit of total risk. Given a portfolio return R_p, risk-free rate R_f, and portfolio volatility σ_p, the Sharpe ratio is  
Sharpe = (E[R_p] - R_f) / σ_p. 
A higher Sharpe indicates better reward per volatility. It assumes returns are normally distributed.  
- **Sortino Ratio**: A variant of Sharpe that uses downside deviation instead of total volatility, thus penalizing only losses. It is defined as (E[R_p] - R_f) / σ_downside, giving more weight to negative risk.  
- **Treynor Ratio**: Similar to Sharpe but uses systematic risk (beta) instead of volatility. Treynor = (E[R_p] - R_f) / β_p, where β_p is the portfolio’s beta to the market.  
- **Information Ratio**: Measures active return (portfolio return minus benchmark return) per unit of tracking error (volatility of active returns).  

**Examples:** If a fund returns 10% with σ = 5% while R_f = 2%, its Sharpe is (10-2)/5 = 1.6. A negative Sharpe indicates returns below risk-free.  

## Stock Market Fundamentals 

Fundamental analysis of stocks uses accounting and valuation metrics:  

- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Net income divided by shares outstanding. EPS = Net Income / Shares Outstanding. It represents profit allocated per share.  
- **Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio:** Share price divided by EPS. P/E = Market Price / EPS. High P/E implies high expectations; low P/E may indicate undervaluation.  
- **Return on Equity (ROE):** Net Income / Shareholders’ Equity. A high ROE (e.g. 20%) means each $1 of equity generates $0.20 of profit.  
- **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF):** Valuation method summing present value of expected future cash flows.  
V = ∑ (CF_t / (1 + r)^t) + (TV / (1 + r)^N)  
where CF_t are future cash flows, r is discount rate, TV is terminal value.  

## Technical Analysis 

Technical indicators use historical prices/volumes to forecast short-term price moves.  

- **Moving Averages (MA):** Smooth out price series. SMA_n = (P_t + P_t-1 + ... + P_t-n+1) / n  
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** EMA_t = α * P_t + (1 - α) * EMA_t-1, α = 2 / (n+1).  
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** RSI = 100 - [100 / (1 + RS)], where RS = Avg Gain / Avg Loss.  
- **MACD:** MACD = EMA_12 - EMA_26. Signal line = EMA_9 of MACD.  
- **Ichimoku Cloud:** Composite of five lines: Tenkan-sen, Kijun-sen, Senkou Span A & B, Chikou Span.  
  - Tenkan-sen = (9-period high + 9-period low) / 2  
  - Kijun-sen = (26-period high + 26-period low) / 2  
  - Senkou Span A = (Tenkan + Kijun) / 2 projected 26 periods forward  
  - Senkou Span B = (52-period high + 52-period low) / 2 projected 26 periods forward  
  - Chikou Span = today’s close plotted 26 periods back  

Technical analysis combines multiple indicators for signals, though outcomes are probabilistic.

## Quantitative Models 

Quantitative finance models link risk factors to expected returns and simulate outcomes.  

- **CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model):** E[R_i] = R_f + β_i (E[R_m] - R_f), where β_i is asset beta.

##  Corporate Finance Concepts

### 1. Cost of Capital
- **WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital)** = (E/V × Re) + (D/V × Rd × (1−Tc))  
  Used to evaluate investment opportunities; lower WACC means cheaper financing.
