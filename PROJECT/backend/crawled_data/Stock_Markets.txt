Stock market today: S&P 500, Dow, Nasdaq steady to start huge week of Big Tech earnings, economic data
Rian Howlett  and Ines Ferré 
Updated Mon, April 28, 2025 at 8:16 PM GMT+5:30 1 min read
## In This Article:
 NQ=F  -0.05% 
ES=F  +0.18% 
YM=F  +0.48% 
Stocks were little changed on Monday to begin a big week of earnings reports and macroeconomic data that will continue to paint an early picture of the US economy's response to President Trump's tariffs.
The S&P 500 (GSPC) rose more than 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered near the flatline, while the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) fell 0.2%.
Wall Street is coming off a rebounding run last week, with the S&P 500 notching its longest daily positive streak since January. The gains came as Trump eased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as well as hinted at light at the end of the tunnel for 145% tariffs on China. Wall Street looks positive, yet skittish, with plenty of room for growth before closing out the last trading week of what has been an eventful April.
Earnings are the highlight of the week ahead, with 180 S&P 500 companies expected to report quarterly financial results. Big Tech leads the way, as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are all due in the coming days, alongside Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Chevron (CVX).
Broader economic news will flavor the coming days, as investors eye Wednesday's release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) index, to see the impact of tariffs on the general public's "core" expenses.
The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown. Economists expect the US economy added 133,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last month, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.

## Texas manufacturing activity falls to lowest since May 2020 as tariffs hammer the outlook
Trump's tariffs continue to crush sentiment across the business and consumer worlds.
New data out Monday morning from the Dallas Fed showed overall activity in its manufacturing survey fell to its lowest level since May 2020, as orders, utilization, and shipments, and the outlook for business all plummeted.
Business activity in Texas plunged in April as tariffs threw the outlook into chaos. (Source: Dallas Fed) 
The Dallas Fed's survey also comes along with robust commentary from business leaders gathered by the bank's staff, which shows how the uncertainty related to tariff policy is manifesting across industries.
"There is really no way to predict anything accurately six months out or even six weeks out now for our industry due to the tariff and trade uncertainty," said an exec in the computer and electric manufacturing industry.
"Carve-outs for large electronics businesses (cellphones and laptops) leaves small business burdened to deal with tariffs on our own, which are likely to cause delays, cancellations and early product obsolescence on existing products and orders. We have already had to turn around and refuse shipments because customers cannot afford the tariffs, delaying our ability to build, which will eventually lead to job losses."
In the food manufacturing industry, one executive said, "Tariffs and tariff uncertainty are wreaking havoc on our supply lines and capital spending plans."
But it's not only tariffs weighing on business outlooks. Another leader in food manufacturing added that, "DOGE without a follow-up plan does nothing for the domestic tranquility needed (stable arena for business to function within)."
And a comment from a leader in the machinery manufacturing industry said it best, encapsulating most of the concerns weighing on businesses and consumers right now.
"Nothing is easy," this exec said.
"Forecasting is extremely challenging in this time of uncertainty. Committing to growth initiatives is anxiety-riddled. Helping our employees keep beans on their table and a roof over their heads is harder. We believe the direction the current administration is leading our country is on target, but the pain to get there may be longer and more intense than originally anticipated."

## Nvidia stock falls as China's Huawei reportedly readies AI chip after Trump's export ban
Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports:
> Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell as much as 2% in early trading Monday following a report that Chinese tech giant Huawei is readying a new advanced AI chip in the wake of President Trump's export ban on Nvidia chips to China.
> The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing unnamed sources, that Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing a new AI chip called the Ascend 910D, which it hopes will be more powerful than than Nvidia's H100 AI chips. The 910D chips are successors to Huawei’s 910B and 910C chips and are still in an early stage of development.
> The Journal also said that Huawei is set to ship more than 800,000 Ascend 910B and 910C chips to customers including state-owned telecommunications carriers and AI developers including TikTok parent ByteDance.

## Stocks edge higher as investors focus on trade negotiations, Big Tech earnings
Stocks mostly edged higher on Monday ahead of more Big Tech earnings this week, with a focus on tariff negotiations between the US and its trading partners.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also gained 0.2%. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) was little changed.
Wall Street is coming off a positive  weekly run, as the S&P 500 gained over 4% last week. President Trump eased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump administration officials have also hinted at easing trade tensions. Investors are hoping for the US to eventually strike a deal with China, though progress on that front is still unclear.
Investors await Big Tech earnings this week with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) all set to report in the coming days.

## 'A big boost to confidence': Markets rally on Trump pivot as trade negotiations drag on
Stock futures were drifting slightly lower Monday morning after they rallied for most of last week on President Trump's softened tone on tariffs and easing threats on Fed independence.

Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal reports:
> The Trump "put" is alive and well.
> Contrary to his role earlier this month when markets plunged on tariff news, Wall Street experts say Trump has stepped in as the perceived market stabilizer — a sign the White House could be paying closer attention to recent volatility, particularly in the bond and currency markets.
> Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, told Yahoo Finance, "This week was a big boost to confidence." He acknowledged that while markets may remain volatile and possibly retest their year-to-date lows, the sharp rebound is significant given the lack of formal trade agreements.
> "Just knowing there's a pivot in place and that the administration is willing to pull back is a positive," he said.

## Why the tariff relief stock rally isn't shaking Wall Street's biggest bear Inbox
Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports:
> Stocks may be in tariff relief rally mode, but Wall Street's biggest bear says investors should stay on high alert given the volatile backdrop.
> "President Trump’s decision to walk back part of his tariff hikes has reduced the odds of a deep US recession. Nevertheless, stocks are not priced for even a mild recession, which suggests that the risk to equities is to the downside," BCA Research chief strategist Peter Berezin warned in a new note.
> Berezin gained attention for being the lone bear on Wall Street coming into 2025. Further, he correctly called in 2022 that there would be no US recession, despite most on the Street bracing for one. He has been an economist for more than 30 years, with stints at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Goldman Sachs, and now BCA Research.
> There are several reasons Berezin is staying the course with his calls for a 75% chance of a US recession this year and S&P 500 (^GSPC) to finish at 4,450 (current level: 5,525).

## Domino's stock falls on surprise sales decline
Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sank over 3% in premarket trading Monday after the pizza chain reported first quarter earnings and a surprise decline in same-store sales.
Reuters reports:
> The world's largest pizza chain's same-store sales in the U.S. fell 0.5%, compared with analysts' average estimate of a 0.5% rise, according to data compiled by LSEG.
> For the first quarter ended March 25, the company posted earnings per share of $4.33, beating estimate of $4.07.
Like Chipotle, which reported earnings last week, Domino's is facing a consumer spending pullback as macroeconomic uncertainty and inflation lead to slowing traffic.
Domino's hopes its partnership with DoorDash (DASH), which is set to be launched in May, will provide a boost to sales, especially in rural and suburban areas.

## Gold extends drop as easing trade war anxiety cools haven demand
Bloomberg News reports:
Gold (GC=F) fell further from last week’s record high as easing trade tensions instill new risk appetite into global markets.
Bullion slid as much as 1.6% to touch $3,268, and has lost more than 5% since peaking above $3,500 on Wednesday.
Investors acted on signs of a thaw in US trade talks, after President Donald Trump on Friday suggested another delay to his higher “reciprocal” tariffs was unlikely. In this context, Asian nations may strike interim deals to stave off levies before the 90-day grace period ends in July. The Trump administration has drafted a framework to handle negotiations with about 18 countries.

## Toyota Industries stock set to pop after parent company announces potential buyout
Shares of Toyota Industries (TYIDF) are poised for a major move higher Monday after parent company Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) announced it is considering investing in a potential buyout of the critical auto parts supplier.
Bloomberg reports:
> Toyota Industries shares remained untraded with a glut of buy orders on Monday. The bid and ask indicated that their price was poised to hit the daily upper limit of 16,225 yen, a 23% jump on Friday's closing price of 13,225 yen.
> Such a rise would mark the stock's biggest one-day jump in at least more than 40 years, according to LSEG data going back to early 1984.
> On Saturday, Toyota said in a filing with the Tokyo stock exchange it was exploring various possibilities, including a partial investment, in Toyota Industries.
> Bloomberg News reported on Friday that Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda and his founding family have proposed acquiring Toyota Industries in a potential 6 trillion yen ($42 billion) deal.

## Oil pushes higher as light shines for trade war with China  
Oil edged higher late Sunday following a turbulent week as easing trade war concerns buffered the commodity. Political issues in Iran and Ukraine also dampened supply forecasts.
Bloomberg reports:
> Brent (BZ=F) climbed above $67 a barrel after dipping 1.6% last week, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) was near $63. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News that talks were ongoing with US trading partners, and “some of those are moving along very well, especially with the Asian countries.”
> In China — the world’s largest crude importer, and economy subject to the harshest US levies — officials plan to hold a press conference later Monday about measures to stabilize employment and ensure stable growth.
> Oil is headed for the biggest monthly loss since 2022 after touching a four-year low. Futures have been burdened by concerns that the US-led trade war will stifle economic activity and hurt energy demand. At the same time, the OPEC+ cartel has compounded bearish sentiment by ramping up idled production. The group will meet on May 5 to discuss output plans for June.

Michael P. Reinking, CFA
Sr. Market Strategist
April 28, 2025 at 9:00 a.m. EST
It is a very quiet start to the week following last week’s rally. The S&P 500 ended up 4.6% trading back above 5,500 the level the index gapped down to following Liberation Day and recouping about half of the peak-to-trough losses. The gains were fueled by a softening of tone related to that Liberation process and earnings that have come in better than feared. Mega-cap tech stocks led to the upside with the NYSE FANG+ index ending the week up 11%. This week is the peak of the earnings season with over a third of the companies in the S&P 500 set to report including the remainder of the Mag 7 ex-NVDA. It will also be a very heavy week of economic data including Q1 GDP, PCE, ISM Manufacturing and the labor market data throughout the week. Futures have traded modestly lower overnight but have just ticked positive.

Anticipation of upside surprises from mega cap tech names—Microsoft, Apple and Amazon are widely expected to report strong top- and bottom-line beats alongside aggressive share-buyback and dividend plans—helped offset lingering trade-war jitters following conflicting U.S. and Chinese statements on tariffs. At the same time, Fed speakers have also left the door ajar for a June rate cut if tariff pressures intensify, and recent retail and services data showed consumer spending holding up under elevated rates.

# Do I (in the UK) need to worry about the US stock market? 
From the value of your pension to your holidays, the turmoil from Trump’s yo-yoing trade policies will have an impact
[Shane Hickey]
Mon 28 Apr 2025 07.00 BSTLast modified on Mon 28 Apr 2025 12.26 BST

A trade war with China and suggestions Donald Trump will sack the head of the Federal Reserve have weighed heavily on the US stock market. It was already reeling after the president’s announcement of universal tariffs on the whole world, and, despite recovering some of its losses, remains down on the start of the year.
In the UK, you may be wondering whether any of it matters to you. The short answer is that it could – without realising it, you may have exposure to the ups and downs of US shares.
Dr Sayantan Ghosh Dastidar, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Derby, says: “In 2023, UK investment managers allocated only [20%] of their portfolios to UK equities – a record low. By comparison, 35% was directed toward US assets.
“There has been a sharp decline in domestic allocation over the past two decades, falling from about 50%, while the allocation to US assets has nearly doubled over the past 10 years.”
Those investment managers are running funds for individuals and organisations, including money saved into UK pensions.
Dan Coatsworth, an analyst at the investment platform AJ Bell, says the popularity of investment in the US, in part driven by large technology companies, means most people’s pensions will have some stake in American firms.
## How could I be affected?
While you may not directly own stocks in US companies, you may have a pension or pensions with investment there.
This can be the case for both defined benefit schemes (also known as final salary schemes), which guarantee an income for life, and defined contribution schemes, where your eventual payment is based on how much you invest and how those investments perform.
For example, almost a third of the pension firm [Aegon’s default fund] is made up of US equities. That is more than the proportion that is made up UK shares and government bonds combined. Meanwhile, [Royal London’s RLP governed portfolio default fund] is 22% US equities – more than UK or European shares. These companies run defined contribution schemes for thousands of employers.
The largest defined benefit scheme in the UK, the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), also holds US equities.
Pension providers should be able to give you fund factsheets to show where your pension is invested, says Helen Morrissey at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, if you want to know the detail.
## Should I be worried?
Coatsworth says the US markets are still up on where they were a decade ago. “The S&P 500 index [one of the benchmark indexes] is down 10% year to date but still up 89% over five years and 150% ahead over 10 years,” he says.
“A long-term investor might still be sitting on big gains if they’ve had US exposure for a while and this year’s dip is no reason to cause alarm. Financial markets regularly move up and down and history suggests that they eventually recover and move higher.”
Some defined contribution schemes will shift you away from equities to cash and bonds the closer you get to retirement, so although the default scheme may invest in the US, you may not have much money exposed to the market.
However, Zoe Alexander, of the [Pensions] and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA), an industry body, says the recent falls may mean people who are about to retire should delay. “[It] may mean now is not the best time to begin drawing your pension or purchase an annuity. It may be a good idea to delay or reduce the amount you take out if you are able to.”
If you are a few years off retiring, advisers say there is time for the markets to recover and regain any losses.
“Though the turbulence is worrying the best thing to do is not to make any kneejerk reactions such as stopping contributions or changing investment strategies,” Morrissey says. “These have the potential of crystallising losses, making it harder for your fund to recover when markets settle.”
Anyone with a defined benefit scheme has less cause to worry as it is up to their employer to ensure there is enough money available to pay their pension income. Some of the funds have large cash “buffers” or surpluses in the case of problems. USS has a £9.7bn surplus, while Barclays Bank UK Retirement Fund, a defined benefit scheme, has a surplus of £1.8bn.
If you are worried about what to do, free guidance is available from the [Money & Pensions Service]. Pension Wise, a government scheme set up to provide specialist guidance, gives free advice to the over-50s.
## Is there anything positive from the market turmoil?
A drop in the value of the dollar means that people who are planning to go to the US for holidays may see their money stretch a little further.
But if you are going to Europe, the exchange rate may be against you.
“Movements so far might persuade some people planning a [US] trip to get at least some of their holiday spending money a bit earlier,” says Sarah Coles of Hargreaves Lansdown. “For those travelling to Europe, the fact that money has flooded to the euro as a relative safe haven has pushed it up against the pound, which means you’ll get less for your money if you’re travelling to the eurozone. It’s going to be even more important to shop around for the best possible exchange rate when you travel.”

**Source:** S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC 
**Release:** Standard & Poors 
**Units:** Index, Not Seasonally Adjusted 
**Frequency:** Daily, Close 
#### Notes:
The observations for the S&P 500 represent the daily index value at market close. The market typically closes at 4 PM ET, except for holidays when it sometimes closes early. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC have reached a new agreement on the use of Standard & Poors and Dow Jones Averages series in FRED. FRED and its associated services will include 10 years of daily history for Standard & Poors and Dow Jones Averages series. The S&P 500 is regarded as a gauge of the large cap U.S. equities market. The index includes 500 leading companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy, which are publicly held on either the NYSE or NASDAQ, and covers 75% of U.S. equities. Since this is a price index and not a total return index, the S&P 500 index here does not contain dividends. Copyright © 2016, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. All rights reserved.

## FAQs
  * [What are shares?]
A share represents part-ownership of a company. So, when you own shares in a company, you own a portion of that company.
As a shareholder you can vote on company matters and get a slice of any profits paid out by the company.
Discover more with our [beginners guide to investing in shares].
  * [Why do share prices move?]
The price movement of a share is driven by the balance between the number of people wanting to buy or sell at any given time. This is known as supply and demand and linked to investors’ views on the company’s future prospects.
If the outlook is improving, more people might want to buy the shares and willing to pay a higher price for those shares. But if a company’s prospects are less rosy, fewer people may be willing to buy the shares or more people might look to sell shares, causing the price to fall.
Discover more with our [beginners guide to investing in shares].
  * [How to buy shares?]
If you’re thinking about buying shares, the good news is that it’s much easier than you might think. In fact, you could do it all online. Here’s how.
1. Choose an account to hold your shares in. You can buy and hold shares in our Fund and Share Account, HL ISA or Self Invested Personal Pension (SIPP). [Find out more and choose an account that's right for you].
2. Select the share you want to buy and check our charges.
3. Buying the shares. Once you have an account open with money ready to invest, you can buy shares. When trading we’ll show you the live share price. You can then choose to accept the price or not.
That’s it. Your shares will be held securely in your account. You can see how they’re doing and deal whenever the market is open, online or with the [HL app].
  * [What does it cost to buy and sell UK shares?]
There are three charges to consider before buying UK shares.
**Dealing charge** Our maximum online dealing fee to buy and sell shares is £11.95 per trade – deal regularly and this could fall to £5.95 per deal. You can also deal over the phone or by post from £20 - £50 per deal.
**Annual charge** There’s no annual charge to hold shares in the [Fund and Share Account]. It costs up to 0.45% per year to hold shares in an HL [ISA] or [SIPP] (capped at £45 in the ISA and £200 in the SIPP).
**Stamp duty and PTM levy** There’s a government stamp duty charge of 0.5% when buying UK listed shares. But you won’t have to pay stamp duty when you sell.
And there’s also a flat £1 fee for those that buy or sell over £10,000 worth of shares. This is the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers levy.
[View a full list of our charges]
  * [Do I pay stamp duty when I buy shares?]
Yes, stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) is paid on all UK equity purchases at the prevailing rate at the time of dealing.
When purchasing UK shares which are able to settle through the UK electronic settlement system CREST, you will pay 0.5% of the value of the trade as Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (“SDRT”). If purchasing “Residual Securities” – those which cannot be settled through the CREST system – you will pay 0.5%, rounded up to the nearest multiple of £5, on any trades valued at greater than £1000.
Stamp duty on Irish registered stock is currently charged at 1%.
  * [When can I buy and sell shares in the UK?]
The UK stock market is open for trading between 8am and 4.30pm on most business days. The only exceptions to this are the last working days before Christmas and the New Year, when the stock market closes at 12.30pm.

At a grocery store in Toronto, shopper Benedykta Mazur has become a bit of a sleuth. 
Since Donald Trump launched a trade war with Canada, she has been trying to buy Canadian as much as possible. Some products, like fresh blueberries in April, are impossible. 
But while she’s willing to pick up something grown in Mexico or Chile, she draws a hard line at anything grown or manufactured in the US.
“It's a no, an absolute no,” she tells me, after Trump announced his latest round of tariffs on the rest of the world.
“This is something that is not going to be just kind of wishy washy,” she says.
Mazur says while Canadians have a reputation for being “really nice”, it is time to turn people’s charms elsewhere, and build partnerships with countries that “share commonalities in regards to how you treat another person, because countries are made of people”.

Rocco Mangiaracina runs a family business in Sicily
Rocco Mangiaracina is an agricultural entrepreneur. His small family business based in Campobello di Mazara, Sicily, produces around 20,000 bottles of olive oil a year.
This is the first year they've started exporting to the US.
“Only a week ago, we sent our first 900 bottles to the American market," he says, adding that he planned to send more bottles but was advised to wait and see how the situation develops.
“Our concern isn’t so much for us, since we’re not the ones bearing the extra costs, but for the importer - who was planning to place another order soon, increase volumes, or expand the product range.
"Now the importer is discouraged by the prospect of having to pay significantly more and, as a result, being forced to raise the final price for consumers.
"This feels like a regression - putting up barriers whose usefulness I struggle to see."

  4. ### Can Trump's tariffs spark a manufacturing boom in India?published at 22:15 British Summer Time 3 April

Trump’s tariffs have rattled global trade, but disruption often creates opportunity. What does this mean for India, the world’s fifth largest and increasingly protectionist economy?
Starting 9 April, Indian goods will face tariffs of up to 27%. Before this, US tariffs averaged just 3.3% - far lower than India’s 17%, per the White House.
Yet, with the US imposing even steeper tariffs on China (54%), Vietnam (46%), Thailand (36%), and Bangladesh (37%), India has a chance to gain ground in textiles, electronics, and machinery, says Delhi-based think tank GTRI.
Higher tariffs on Chinese and Bangladeshi exports could help Indian manufacturers expand in the US, while a shift in semiconductor supply chains from Taiwan (32% tariffs) could also benefit India - if it builds the right infrastructure.

     * The **Chinese government** has promised [“resolute countermeasures”](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/<https:/www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c1dr7vy39eet?post=asset%3A8049a310-394b-4bdb-a6e9-a05a01e01a53#post>), which will hurt American companies trying to sell into China's market 
     * **South Africa** ’s presidency has said that the tariffs "affirm the urgency to negotiate a new bilateral and mutually beneficial trade agreement with Washington" 
     * In **Brazil** , its foreign ministry said the government is "evaluating all possible actions to ensure reciprocity in bilateral trade", according to the Reuters news agency 
     * Over in **Australia** , Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has described the tariffs as not being "the act of a friend", adding that [they are "unwarranted"](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/<https:/www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c1dr7vy39eet?post=asset%3Acee94f7b-6ea4-4ff7-9c78-e9e7a4283caf#post>)

     * **Poland** 's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the tariffs [could cost Poland losses of more than $2.6bn,](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/<https:/www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c1dr7vy39eet?post=asset%3A8934663b-7bf7-4f5f-b1a9-0971010818df#post>) calling it a “severe and unpleasant blow”

Trump speaking to reporters a short time ago on Air Force One
On his flight from Washington DC to Miami this afternoon, President Trump surprised reporters in the back of the plane by stopping by for an extended question-and-answer session.
Over the course of 20 minutes, Trump answered a wide range of questions, about everything from TikTok and Elon Musk's future to the Chagos Islands and New York's mayoral race.
The bulk of the questions, however, were on tariffs.
In response to a BBC question on his message to American workers and businesses that may ultimately feel the impact of retaliatory tariffs, Trump said: "I think it's going to all work out."
"Remember, there are no tariffs if you build your plant, or make your product in the US," he said. "There's going to be a transition period, because they're going to be building instead of paying tariffs to some other place."
"All you have to do is build or make your product in the United States, and a lot of people are doing that," he added.
According to Trump, he spoke to two of the five major automobile manufacturers.
"They've already started moving their parts-making out of Mexico, out of Canada, and into the United States," he said.

 _**As we've reported, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has**_[sharply reduced its forecasts for global trade](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/<https:/www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c1dr7vy39eet?post=asset%3A04d7cd40-03b3-4746-9838-aa071e5b7a05#post>) _**because of President Trump's global tariffs. Malcom asks about the role of the WTO in the imposition of tariffs.**_
When it comes to the rules of global trade, including tariffs, the WTO is supposed to decide and enforce them.
Under President Trump, there has been mixed messaging from the United States because it remains somewhat but not fully engaged. 
The American complaint, from both Republicans and Democrats, has been that the WTO system doesn’t treat America fairly - by which they mean China gets preferential treatment on global trade.
The US also thinks WTO ruling have overstepped their remit to its detriment. 
One example would be the steel and aluminium tariffs imposed by President Trump in his first term.
The WTO said they were against the rules but President Joe Biden's administration ignored that, arguing as Trump had, they were allowed under national security provisions.
That argument has also been used this time so a similar response can be expected. 
In recent weeks, the Trump administration has withheld about $25m of funding from the WTO meaning it faces restrictions on what it can do there.
However, hope of engagement comes in President Trump's nomination of a new ambassador to the Geneva based institution - Joseph Barloon’s appointment is pending Congressional approval.

The US will also see its first quarter GDP data reported this Wednesday. All of this while China continues to deny any conversation with the US on tariffs.

### US Stock Market LIVE: Cemex shares soar as income hits record despite lower profit
Cemex SAB’s shares climbed after it posted record net income in the first quarter, with the Mexican company benefiting from higher prices and embarking on an extensive cost-cutting program.
The cement maker’s net income was a record $734 million, more than double compared to the same period a year ago, and far surpassing analyst estimates. The company has raised prices and is working to sell non-core assets as part of its cost-cutting efforts.
Cemex’s shares rose as much as 3.4% on the Mexican stock exchange Monday, reaching their highest intraday value in over a month. They’re up 3.1% so far this year.

### US Stock Market LIVE: Sony weighs chip spinoff that Dan Loeb called for years ago
Sony Group Corp. is considering spinning off its semiconductor unit, according to people familiar with the matter, marking the PlayStation maker’s latest effort to streamline its business and focus on entertainment.
The spinoff and listing of Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corp. may occur as soon as this year, the people said, asking not to be named, discussing a private matter. Sony is considering distributing the bulk of its holding in the chip business to shareholders, and may retain a minority holding after the spinoff, one of the people said.
Deliberations are ongoing, and the plan may change, especially given the volatility of markets in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, one of the people said. A representative of Sony declined to comment. A Sony Semiconductor spokesperson said he could not comment on speculation.

### US Stock Market LIVE: S&P 500 can fall more than 10% from here amid tariff uncertainty, US Bank Asset Management says
The S&P 500 could see a double-digit percentage decline as investors await clarity on President Donald Trump’s tariffs, according to Thomas Hainlin of US Bank Asset Management.
The firm’s senior investment strategist told CNBC that the broad market index could move to 4,800 and up to 5,600 on the high side until there’s some resolution on tariff negotiations. That forecast implies 13.1% downside and just 1.4% upside, respectively, from Friday’s close.
“The question is, does that extend long enough that you actually start to see damage to the consumer and to corporate America? We haven’t seen it yet,” Hainlin told CNBC. “I think we’re still in this base case.”

### US Stock Market LIVE: US urges Eastern Europe to split from EU energy transition aims
The US wants central and eastern European countries to join its path of “energy freedom” instead of following the wider region’s transition to a net-zero economy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in Warsaw.
The Energy Secretary told the Three Seas Business Forum, which numerous leaders from the region attended Monday, that western Europe chose the wrong path of expensive “top-down imposition of enforced climate policies.” He argued that renewables investments weigh on growth and boost revenues of foreign companies, and that Eastern Europe should pick a different path.
“Central Europe faces a time for choosing,” Wright told conference participants. “We warmly welcome you to join us on Team Energy Freedom and Prosperity for Citizens.”

### US Stock Market LIVE: Cargill sees trade war as risk to its Brazil soy crush plans
US President Donald Trump’s trade war with China may be beneficial for Brazil’s soybean exports, but Cargill Inc.’s top executive in the country sees a risk to the company’s plans to expand oilseed crushing capacity.
Increased Chinese demand for Brazilian soybeans would mean more competition in the South American nation for the same oilseeds used by crushers to produce soybean oil, biofuels and soybean meal, Cargill Brazil President Paulo Sousa said in an interview. Uncertainties related to tariffs could influence the company’s plans for more crushing capacity in Brazil.
“We always look at a pipeline of investments, but we need to see if these unfavorable tariffs to Brazilian soy crushing will continue,” Sousa said. “If so, we would need to reconsider.”
He added that it’s not as easy solution to simply say Brazil needs to produce more, as global demand remains unchanged. His comments came as the world’s largest commodities trader swung to a 2024 loss in Brazil on unfavorable exchange rates and fluctuations in crop prices.

### US Stock Market LIVE: US stocks edge higher as traders mull trade headlines, earnings
US stocks traded slightly higher Monday morning as investors braced for a busy week of corporate earnings and assessed the latest tariff developments.
The S&P 500 Index rose 0.2% at 9:33 a.m. in New York, while the Nasdaq 100 Index was little changed. The Cboe VIX Index hovered near 25. Boeing Co. gained 2.41% as Airbus SE agreed to take over some assets and sites from Spirit AeroSystems, clearing the way for Spirit to be acquired by Boeing.
Apr 28, 2025 7:44 PM IST
### US Stock Market LIVE: European stocks resume climb as M&A news outweighs trade worries
European equities climbed as investors grew more optimistic that the worst-case impacts from US tariffs could be averted and as they parsed a flurry of merger and acquisition news.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was up 0.7% by 14:35 p.m. in London, gaining for a fifth session in the longest winning streak since January. Germany’s index DAX advanced 0.7%, recouping all of its losses since April 2, when President Donald Trump announced his reciprocal tariffs.
Portugal’s PSI 20 Index fell 1% as earnings from Galp Energia SGPS SA weighed, while Spain’s IBEX 35 Index trimmed earlier gains to trade 0.8% higher. Both countries were hit by a major blackout, though their respective stock markets were operating normally.
Bank shares were among the biggest outperformers, lifted by Banca Generali SpA, which jumped as much as 9.7% after Mediobanca SpA launched a surprise €6.3 billion ($7.2 billion) offer for the wealth manager.

### US Stock Market LIVE: S&P 500 eyes longest winning run since November
Wall Street traders bracing for a deluge of corporate earnings and key economic data sent stocks higher on Monday as they waited for more insights on President Donald Trump’s trade war.
A fifth straight advance in the S&P 500 is the longest since November. Before the end of a volatile April, investors obsessed with every twist of global tariff developments will wade through a raft of results from heavyweights like Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.

### US Stock Market LIVE: ECB's Guindos warns of disorderly market risk amid trade turmoil
European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said that volatile financial markets must be watched closely amid the risk of declines spiralling out of control.
Speaking to European Parliament lawmakers in Brussels on Monday, he warned that despite a resilient banking system in the region, officials can’t take anything for granted.
“The recent trade policy upheaval has triggered the most significant financial market turmoil since the pandemic,” Guindos said. “These developments warrant careful monitoring. Sharp adjustments in financial markets could become disorderly, particularly if they are amplified by the growing size and influence of non-bank financial institutions.”

### US Stock Market LIVE: Bessent says 'It's up to China to de-escalate' in trade war
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said “all aspects” of the US government are in contact with China but that it’s up to Beijing to take the first step in de-escalating the tariff fight with the US due to the imbalance of trade between the two nations.
“We’ll see where this goes,” Bessent said in an interview with CNBC. “As I’ve repeatedly said, I believe it’s up to China to de-escalate because they sell five times more to us than we sell to them, so these 125% tariffs are unsustainable.”
The Chinese exempting some goods from tariffs indicates they are interested in reducing tensions, Bessent said, adding that he has “an escalation ladder in my back pocket and we’re very anxious not to have to use it.” Escalation could include an “embargo,” he said.
Apr 28, 2025 7:10 PM IST
### US Stock Market LIVE: Oil steadies as traders await next moves in China, US-Iran talks
Oil was little changed as traders parsed the latest signals in the trade war, including China’s efforts to support its tariff-hit economy, and weighed geopolitical developments on Iran.
Brent traded near $67 a barrel after dipping 1.6% last week. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News that talks were ongoing with US trading partners, and “some of those are moving along very well, especially with the Asian countries.”

### US Stock Market LIVE: Carney’s edge slips as Canada election comes to hectic end
The Conservative Party chipped away at the lead held by Mark Carney’s Liberals in the final days of Canada’s election campaign, though surveys still point to a probable Liberal victory in Monday’s vote.
The Liberals’ estimated popular vote share was 41% in Abacus Data’s final likely-voter election model, released over the weekend, just two points ahead of the Conservatives. The polling company had reported a five-point Liberal advantage on April 21.
The dominant ballot question for much of the 37-day campaign was which candidate will best stand up for Canada against aggressive actions from US President Donald Trump, and voters prefer Carney on that issue, according to multiple surveys.

### US Stock Market LIVE: S&P 500 inches higher as traders await Big Tech earnings, progress on trade deals
S&P 500 moved higher Monday ahead of a packed week for earnings and economic data. Wall Street is also awaiting any progress on trade deal negotiations.
The S&P 500 gained about 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also jumped 178 points, or 0.4%.
Apr 28, 2025 6:59 PM IST
### US Stock Market LIVE: S&P 500 futures inch higher as traders await Big Tech earnings, progress on trade deals
S&P 500 futures moved higher Monday ahead of a packed week for earnings and economic data. Wall Street is also awaiting any progress on trade deal negotiations. Futures linked to the S&P 500 rose 0.1%, along with Nasdaq 100 futures. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 79 points, or 0.2%.
On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent offered little clarity on the direction of reaching a possible trade agreement with China, but said that the onus was not on the United States. On the positive side, however, Bessent said that they were making progress on other trade proposals, suggesting a deal with India would be “one of the first” to come.

### US Stock Market LIVE: AI Startup Nscale chases ByteDance deal and $1.8 billion in debt
Nscale, a startup that is less than a year old, is already trying to raise about $2.7 billion to build artificial intelligence infrastructure on the back of a pending partnership with ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese owner of TikTok, according to an offering document seen by Bloomberg.
The money, if Nscale follows through with the proposal, would allow the London-based company to build out data centers around the globe — filled with Nvidia Corp. chips — that would be rented out by companies such as ByteDance, in order to train and operate their AI models.
The biggest chunk of the financing would be a $1.8 billion private credit deal led by Goldman Sachs bankers, according to the offering document that was prepared for investors. Nscale has also been trying to raise another $900 million in preferred equity and convertible shares, the document shows.
Apr 28, 2025 6:46 PM IST
### US Stock Market LIVE: Trump's desire for cheap crude puts big oil's plans to test
Big Oil has a powerful ally in the White House, but the first quarter of Donald Trump’s presidency was a real test for companies’ plans. The rest of the year could be even tougher.
The US leader’s desire for lower crude prices and his disruption of the global economy with trade tariffs is stressing the industry’s finances, calling into question both shareholder returns and drilling plans.
Of the five global oil majors that report earnings next week, BP Plc is first in line and the most exposed to recent volatility. Even before Trump’s trade war, the company’s debt was rising and it had told investors to expect a reduction in quarterly share buybacks of as much as $1 billion.
Apr 28, 2025 6:44 PM IST
### US Stock Market LIVE: European stocks rise; FTSE 100 poised for best winning streak in over 5 years
European markets were higher with nearly all sectors in the green on Monday, as investors brace for a slew of major earnings and data releases both in Europe and the U.S. this week.
The Stoxx 600 index was 0.4% higher at 12:10 p.m. in London, with the travel and banking sectors leading the gains. The regional index added 2.77% last week, continuing to claw back losses from the steep early April sell-off related to U.S. tariffs.
London’s FTSE 100 index was up by around 0.2% on Monday morning, putting it on course for its 11th consecutive day of gains and its best run since late 2019.
Apr 28, 2025 6:40 PM IST
### US Stock Market LIVE: Wells Fargo says CFPB ends consent order dating back to 2018
Wells Fargo & Co. said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau terminated a consent order dating back to 2018 related to the bank’s compliance risk-management program, the sixth such order ended this year.
The move is the latest in the San Francisco-based company’s efforts to shake off regulatory restrictions after scandals that emerged starting in 2016. Wells Fargo said in a statement Monday that the action was the 12th consent order resolved with regulators since 2019.
“Today’s termination, along with the recent closure of other consent orders, demonstrates that we have completed much of our common risk and control infrastructure work, including work that is required by other orders,” Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf said in the statement. “Wells Fargo is a different and stronger company today.”

### US Stock Market LIVE: IBM pledges $150 billion to boost US tech growth, computer manufacturing
International Business Machines Corporation on Monday announced it will invest $150 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, including more than $30 billion to advance American manufacturing of its mainframe and quantum computers.
“We have been focused on American jobs and manufacturing since our founding 114 years ago, and with this investment and manufacturing commitment, we are ensuring that IBM remains the epicenter of the world’s most advanced computing and AI capabilities,” IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in a release.
Apr 28, 2025 6:29 PM IST
### US Stock Market LIVE: Deliveroo shares jump after $3.6 billion DoorDash offer
Deliveroo Plc shares surged by more than 18% on Monday, the most since 2021, after the British delivery firm disclosed an acquisition offer from DoorDash Inc.
On Friday, Deliveroo said in a filing that it had received a cash offer from DoorDash at £1.80 per Deliveroo share. That would value the company at about $3.6 billion, according to calculations by Bloomberg. In the filing, Deliveroo said it would be “minded to recommend such an offer” to shareholders at those terms.
Shares were trading at 171.30 pence in London at 8:15 a.m. on Monday, giving the company a market value of around £2.5 billion ($3.3 billion). Deliveroo shares have risen about 19% this year.
Apr 28, 2025 6:19 PM IST
### US Stock Market LIVE: US stock futures steady before barrage of earnings
US equity futures posted small moves as investors awaited reports from American companies worth $20 trillion, and watched for progress in US trade talks with Asian partners.
Wild gyrations sparked by President Donald Trump’s April 2 tariff announcements have eased somewhat, but investors will be scrutinising this week’s key company reports for the earnings impact of US trade policies. Fresh readings on the state of the American economy may support hopes of earlier-than-expected Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts.
Apr 28, 2025 6:16 PM IST
###  US Stock Market LIVE: India, UK spar over key issues as trade pact nears finish line
Talks between the UK and India on a free trade agreement have entered the final stretch, with both sides now wrangling over five unresolved issues, according to an official in New Delhi familiar with the matter.
India’s Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal will tackle some of these issues during his two-day visit to the UK that begins Monday, the person said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are private. He is scheduled to meet Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, the person added.
Apr 28, 2025 6:07 PM IST
###  US Stock Market LIVE: Drillers in Canada shift to gas as trade war hammers oil prices
Drillers in Canada’s energy heartland of Alberta are shifting their focus to natural gas as the global trade war and an OPEC+ plan to increase output hammer crude prices.
The number of licenses for new gas wells issued in the first quarter rose 26% from the previous quarter to 308, the highest quarterly total in two years, Alberta Energy Regulator data show. For oil wells, the number fell 24% to 293, the lowest since 2021. Licenses for bitumen wells fell by six to 37.
Canada is the world’s fourth-largest oil producer and the fifth-largest gas producer, according to the International Energy Agency. Nearly all of its oil and much of its gas is exported to the US.

### US Stock Market LIVE: Private equity firms target defense assets once seen as toxic
Private equity firms are scouring for investment opportunities in European defense, chasing the once-shunned sector in an effort to benefit from a historic switch to military expansion in the region.
Firms including Tikehau Capital and CVC Capital Partners have either been raising funds or putting together teams dedicated to investing in companies that help underpin national security. Others, Advent for instance, are preparing to shop defense assets to take advantage of the rising buyer demand.
Apr 28, 2025 6:00 PM IST
### US Stock Market LIVE: Treasury market's 'new world order' brings fear of long bond
The “Sell America” trade that gripped markets this month has left a potentially lasting dent in investors’ willingness to hold the US government’s longest-maturity debt, a mainstay of its deficit-financing toolkit.
For bond managers at BlackRock Inc., Brandywine Global Investment Management and Vanguard Group Inc., the problem is that as President Donald Trump approaches his 100th day in office, he has generated a growing list of unknowns, forcing traders to focus on a broad array of issues beyond just the likely path of interest rates.
Apr 28, 2025 5:44 PM IST
### US Stock Market LIVE: US stock futures steady before barrage of earnings
US equity futures posted small moves as investors awaited reports from American companies worth $20 trillion, and watched for progress in US trade talks with Asian partners.
Wild gyrations sparked by President Donald Trump’s April 2 tariff announcements have eased somewhat, but investors will be scrutinising this week’s key company reports for the earnings impact of US trade policies. Fresh readings on the state of the American economy may support hopes of earlier-than-expected Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts.
Contracts for the S&P 500 were little changed following a four-day rally in US equities, the longest winning streak since January. Europe’s Stoxx 600 rose 0.5%, boosted by M&A news out of Italy as Mediobanca made a €6.3 billion ($7.1 billion) offer for the wealth management arm of Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali SpA.
Apr 28, 2025 5:38 PM IST
### US Stock Market LIVE: Trump promised a markets boom. 100 days in, stocks have only seen damage
Donald Trump promised Americans a “boom like no other” if they elected him president. But based on the stock market’s performance during his first 100 days in office, it depends on what you mean by “boom.”
The action certainly has been explosive, just not in the way investors were hoping. By April 30, Trump will have closed out his first 100 days in office. Despite last week’s rally, the S&P 500 Index is down about 8% since his inauguration and on track for its worst run during a president’s first 100 days since Gerald Ford in 1974, following Richard Nixon’s resignation.
It’s a U-turn that few on Wall Street saw coming after two straight years of over 20% gains and what was expected to be a pro-growth agenda. Instead, markets swung wildly as Trump slapped tariffs on basically every country where US companies operate — and then suspended some, carved out exceptions for certain industries, and ratcheted up the trade war with China.
Apr 28, 2025 5:24 PM IST
### US Stock Market LIVE: Spain and Portugal hit by widespread power blackouts
Most of Spain and parts of Portugal were hit by a major blackout that impacted power and phone lines at around noon on Monday.
Public transport, traffic lights and phone services were mostly down in parts of Madrid, Barcelona and Lisbon due to the outage, while trains were mostly halted.
The government and grid operator Red Electrica are seeking to determine the reason for the outage, according to two statements. Backup plans have been put in place by utilities, the Spanish operator said on X.
Spain’s Canary and Balearic Islands were unaffected, and the market is operating normally.
Apr 28, 2025 5:13 PM IST
### US Stock Market LIVE: European power prices drop far below zero as solar output surges
Power prices across Europe plunged deep below zero this weekend as sunny weather boosted output from the region’s growing fleet of solar parks.
The phenomenon of negative prices has become a regular occurrence over the past few years in the region, but levels far below zero are still unusual. In March, the number of negative hours doubled in Germany from a year earlier, according to Epex Spot SE data.
Solar energy production typically soars in April with longer and sunnier days. That, combined with a dip in heating demand, pushes prices lower. The drop well below -€100 per megawatt-hour this weekend highlights the absence of large-scale battery storage in Europe to ease the supply-demand imbalance.
Apr 28, 2025 5:02 PM IST
### US Stock Market Live: European Stocks Resume Climb
European equities climbed as investors grew more optimistic that the worst-case impacts from US tariffs could be averted and as they parsed a flurry of merger and acquisition news.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was up 0.5% by 11:54 a.m. in London, gaining for a fifth session in the longest winning streak since January. Germany’s index DAX advanced 0.7%, recouping all of its losses since April 2, when President Donald Trump announced his reciprocal tariffs.
Bank shares were among the biggest outperformers, lifted by Banca Generali SpA, which jumped as much as 9.7% after Mediobanca SpA launched a surprise €6.3 billion ($7.2 billion) offer for the wealth manager.

#  Are you interested by European Stock Market ? 
Discussion  
Hi everyone !! 
I know we’re going through a tough market moment. I’m French, and as a Frenchman, I have access to stock portfolios with tax advantages. We benefit from a kind of liquidity basket where you can buy and sell European stocks without being taxed, as long as nothing leaves the basket (otherwise, capital gains tax applies, though it’s reduced after 5 years). You can even invest in US index ETFs within it.When investing in the US, I’ve started to balance my US ETFs with European stocks. The observation is clear: my European stocks have clearly outperformed my US ones. When I read their financial reports and business updates, it’s extremely positive, and unlike before, they’re being rewarded with rising stock prices. That’s not all : while large-cap stocks also suffered from the April 7 dip, my European small-caps held up incredibly well and continued to rise.I know people tend to overlook Europe and focus mainly on US markets. But I think the European market is currently offering a real investment opportunity: 
  * Huge investments from the EU and member states. Notable examples include Germany’s €1 trillion plan, France’s €150 billion plan for data centers, the European rearmament plan, and the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, which heavily benefits Italy (€750 billion). 
  * Companies are no longer afraid to expand beyond Europe. Legrand is a leader in data centers and has a strong presence in the US, as does Schneider Electric. SAP is ready to take on the likes of ServiceNow. We have true multinationals with strong growth potential. 
  * Banking sector : very good economic situation for them, 
  * Small-caps are following suit and standing out, some even securing major US clients like Tesla. 


I’d love to know if anyone is interested in European stocks, or if you’re solely focused on the US.A little plug: I’ve started a Twitter account (@Ricky_Macchiato) to talk about the European and US stocks I’m targeting, share my ideas, etc. (No investment advice). It’s currently in French, but if there’s interest, I can switch it to English.I’m not here to preach, but I strongly believe in diversification to reduce risk. I invest in the US, Europe (Eurozone and beyond), China A and H shares .I’d love to hear your feedback, know if anyone’s curious, etc. Feel free to ask questions or share your thoughts—I’ll do my best to respond. But I’ll repeat: I’m not a professional, and I’m not giving investment advice. I’m just sharing my opinions and personal choices as a finance enthusiast.

A stock market is a place where companies raise capital by selling shares of stock (also known as 'equity') to investors. Most stocks give shareholders voting rights and a residual claim on corporate earnings in the form of capital gains and dividends. 
Stock markets also allow existing shares of publicly traded companies to change hands, where individuals and institutions can invest in companies to potentially profit from their success or speculate on shorter-term price movements. They play a crucial role in price discovery, as the collective actions of buyers and sellers determine the market value of companies. Moreover, stock markets promote corporate transparency and accountability, as public companies must adhere to regulatory standards and disclose financial information to shareholders. 
Through their functioning, stock markets serve as important economic indicators, reflecting investor sentiment and a barometer of overall economic health. When stock prices rise, it often signals investor confidence in the economy, while falling prices may indicate concerns about economic stability. 
### Key Takeaways
  * Stocks represent ownership equity in a firm, and many give shareholders voting rights, as well as a residual claim on corporate earnings in the form of capital gains and dividends.
  * Individual and institutional investors come together on stock exchanges to buy and sell shares in a public venue.
  * Share prices are set by supply and demand as buyers and sellers place orders.

##  How Do Stock Markets Work? 
Stock markets are organized platforms where buyers and sellers come together to trade shares of publicly listed companies. At their core, these markets operate on the principle of supply and demand, with share prices fluctuating based on companies' perceived value and overall market conditions. When more people want to buy a stock than sell it, the price typically rises, while the opposite is true. 
Stock markets facilitate both a primary and a secondary market. The primary market is where new stocks are first issued through initial public offerings (IPOs). Here, companies sell shares directly to investors, raising capital for business operations or expansion. Once these shares are in circulation, they enter the secondary market, where most daily trading occurs. In the secondary market, investors trade existing shares among themselves, with the company no longer directly involved in these transactions.

Stock exchanges, such as the [New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ], provide the infrastructure for these trades to take place. They maintain orderly markets, ensure compliance with regulations, and disseminate real-time price information. Modern stock markets largely operate electronically, with sophisticated computer systems matching buy and sell orders almost instantaneously. 
Various market participants play important roles in the functioning of stock markets. These include: 
  * Individual and institutional investors (like mutual funds and pension funds) who own shares
  * Traders who buy and sell over short time horizons
  * [Market makers] (MMs) who provide [liquidity]
  * Brokers who facilitate trades


Additionally, regulatory bodies oversee market operations to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Together, these elements create a complex ecosystem that enables efficient capital allocation and provides opportunities for investment and wealth creation. 
###  How Do Stocks Work? 
When a company wants to raise capital, it divides what it believes to be the total amount of capital needed into slices of ownership with a specific value. These slices are called shares and usually represent a percentage of ownership in a company. Commonly, but not always, these shares come with voting rights and the potential to receive a portion of the company's profits through dividends or capital appreciation. The shares issued by the company to shareholders are called outstanding shares because investors, not the corporation, hold them. 
The total value of a company's [outstanding shares] is known as its market capitalization, which fluctuates based on the current stock price and the number of shares issued. 
Market capitalization rises and falls with the current market price of the shares and reflects the value placed on a company by the market. 
##  Why Stock Markets Are Important 
Stock markets are integral to modern economies. They provide companies with access to capital by allowing them to sell shares to the public, enabling businesses to fund growth, innovation, and expansion. The influx of capital received from IPOs drives economic development, job creation, and technological advancement, benefiting society as a whole. 
Beyond capital raising, stock markets facilitate the efficient allocation of resources. They do this through the price discovery process, where the prices of stocks are determined in real time by the collective actions of buyers and sellers. This mechanism helps ensure that capital is directed towards the most promising and productive enterprises. Investors, through their buying and selling decisions, signal which companies they believe will succeed and grow—and those which may not. This dynamic process helps allocate resources to their most efficient uses, promoting overall economic efficiency. 
For investors, stock markets provide opportunities to grow wealth over time. By purchasing shares, individuals and institutions can participate in the financial successes (or failures) of companies. Access to stock markets allows a broad range of people to build financial security and work towards long-term goals such as retirement or education funding. Today, many individuals rely on stock investments to fund future goals such as retirement savings, college tuition, and even healthcare spending. 
Stock markets also serve as barometers of broad economic health and investor sentiment. Market indices, such as the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average, provide snapshots of overall market performance, often reflecting broader economic trends and expectations. Policymakers, businesses, and individuals frequently use these indicators to inform decision-making, from monetary policy and business strategies to personal financial planning. 
##  Major Stock Exchanges 
Stock exchanges date back to the 17th century, with the [Amsterdam Stock Exchange], established in 1602, often cited as the world's first formal stock market.1 However, the concept of trading company shares existed even earlier, with the Roman Republic having a system for trading shares in _publicani_ companies.2 As commerce and industry grew, so did the need for organized markets to facilitate the trading of securities. 
In the United States, the first U.S. stock exchange was the [Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX)], founded in 1790, which still exists today.3 The more famous [New York Stock Exchange] (NYSE) dates back to 1792, when 24 brokers signed the [Buttonwood Agreement], establishing rules for trading securities. The NYSE has since grown to become one of the world's largest and most influential exchanges. The second major U.S. exchange, [NASDAQ], was founded in 1971 as the world's first electronic stock market. Today, these two exchanges dominate the U.S. landscape, with the NYSE known for its auction-based trading system and blue-chip stocks, while NASDAQ is home to many technology and growth companies. 
Internationally, several major exchanges also exist. The [London Stock Exchange], founded in 1801, is one of Europe's oldest and largest. In Asia, the [Tokyo Stock Exchange,] established in 1878, is Japan's primary bourse, while the [Shanghai Stock Exchange], reopened in 1990 after a long hiatus, has become increasingly important as China's economy has grown.456 Other significant exchanges include the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, [Euronext] (which operates markets in Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Lisbon, London, Oslo, and Paris), and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. 
In most developed countries, stock exchanges are formed as self-regulatory organizations (SROs), nongovernmental organizations that have the power to create and enforce industry regulations and standards. The advent of electronic trading has revolutionized stock exchanges worldwide. Starting with NASDAQ's electronic system in the 1970s, most major exchanges have now either fully transitioned to electronic trading or operate hybrid systems. This shift has dramatically increased trading speed and efficiency, reduced costs, and improved market access for a wider range of participants. It has also facilitated the rise of alternative trading systems (ATS) and dark pools, challenging traditional exchanges and reshaping the global financial landscape. 
### Fast Fact
The original method of stock market trading was based on a manual system known as the open outcry system, where traders used verbal and hand signal communications to buy and sell large blocks of stocks in the trading pit or the exchange floor.
##  Over-the-Counter Exchanges 
There also exist several loosely regulated over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges, which may also be referred to as bulletin boards (OTCBB). Shares listed OTC tend to be riskier since they list companies that fail to meet the more strict listing criteria of bigger exchanges. Larger exchanges may require that a company has been in operation for a certain amount of time before being listed and that it meets certain conditions regarding company value and profitability.7

##  Why Does the Stock Market Go Up and Down? 
The stock market's movements are influenced by several factors that affect investor sentiment and economic conditions. These factors can range from macroeconomic indicators, such as interest rates, inflation, and GDP growth, to company-specific news, like earnings reports, product launches, or leadership changes. Political events, international trade policies, and geopolitical tensions also play significant roles. When positive news or data points emerge, investors are often more willing to buy stocks, driving prices up. Conversely, negative news can lead to selling, causing prices to fall. 
When the demand for a particular stock increases due to favorable news, profit outlook, or investor optimism, its price tends to rise. Conversely, when supply outweighs demand, often driven by negative sentiment or poor performance, stock prices fall. A constant flux in supply and demand is the essence of price discovery, where the collective actions of buyers and sellers determine the fair market value of stocks based on available information. 
Sometimes, the price discovery mechanism can fall out of whack, leading to price bubbles and crashes. A bubble occurs when stock prices rise significantly above their fundamental or intrinsic values, driven by exuberant market psychology, herding behavior, and speculative buying. For instance, the [Dot-com Bubble] of the late 1990s saw technology stocks soar to unsustainable levels, fueled by high expectations for internet-based companies. When the bubble burst in 2000, it led to a sharp market decline as investors realized the overvaluation.8
A market crash is a sudden and severe drop in stock prices, often triggered by panic selling and widespread fear. The [2008 Financial Crisis] is a prominent example, where the collapse of the housing market and the failure of major financial institutions led to a dramatic decline in stock prices worldwide.9 Crashes can lead to significant economic repercussions, including recessions and long-term market instability. 
### Important
Despite their dramatic impact, both bubbles and crashes have historically resolved themselves over time. Markets eventually find a new equilibrium as investor confidence is restored, economic fundamentals improve, and regulatory measures are implemented to prevent future excesses. This cyclical nature of market movements underscores both the volatility and the resilience of financial systems and the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective in investing.
###  Market Volatility 
[Volatility] in the market refers to the degree of variation in stock prices over a given period. High volatility means that stock prices can change rapidly and unpredictably, while low volatility indicates more stable prices. 
Volatility is a natural part of stock markets and can be influenced by both systemic factors, such as economic changes or political events, and specific factors, such as company performance or sector-specific news. For investors, volatility can represent both a risk and an opportunity. While high volatility can generate significant gains, it also increases the risk of substantial losses. Managing volatility is a key aspect of investment strategy, requiring careful analysis and a long-term perspective. 
##  Stock Market Indexes 
Indexes represent aggregated prices of several different stocks, and the movement of an index is the net effect of the movements of each component. Major stock market indexes include the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the S&P 500. 
The DJIA is a [price-weighted index] of 30 large American corporations. Because of its weighting scheme and the fact that it only consists of 30 stocks (when there are many thousands to choose from), it is not necessarily the best indicator of how the stock market is doing.10 The S&P 500 is a market-capitalization-weighted index of the 500 largest companies in the U.S. and is a much more useful indicator.11
Indexes can be broad, such as the Dow Jones or S&P 500, or specific to a certain industry or market sector. Investors can trade indexes indirectly via futures markets or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which act just like stocks on stock exchanges. 
A market index is a popular measure of stock market performance. Most market indexes are market-cap-weighted, which means that the weight of each index constituent is proportional to its market capitalization. Keep in mind, though, that a few of them are price-weighted, such as the DJIA. In addition to the DJIA, other widely watched indexes in the U.S. and internationally include the following: 
  * S&P 500
  * Nasdaq Composite
  * Russell Indexes (Russell 1000, Russell 2000)
  * TSX Composite (Canada)
  * FTSE Index (United Kingdom)
  * Nikkei 225 (Japan)
  * Dax Index (Germany)
  * CAC 40 Index (France)
  * CSI 300 Index (China)
  * Sensex (India)


##  How to Invest in the Stock Market for Beginners 
Numerous studies have shown that, over long periods, stocks generate investment returns that are superior to those from every other asset class. Stock returns arise from capital gains and dividends.12
Many of us are already invested in the stock market, whether we realize it or whether or not we play an active role in our investments. This happens through participation in retirement accounts like 401(k)s or pension plans, college savings accounts, or health savings accounts (HSAs). 
To take a more active role in the stock market, you can also choose to hold specific stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds. [Understanding how to invest in the stock market] can help you make more informed decisions, maximize returns, and manage risks effectively. 
###  Choose Your Investment Strategy 
There are several strategies you can adopt when investing in the stock market, each with its own risk and return profile: 
  1. **Buy-and-Hold** : This passive strategy involves purchasing stocks and holding them for a long period, regardless of market fluctuations. The idea is that, over time, the stock market tends to increase in value, and long-term investments will benefit from this upward trend. Buy-and-hold strategies include investing in index funds over long time horizons.
  2. **Growth Investing** : Growth investing focuses on finding companies expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies. These stocks may not pay dividends but have the potential for significant capital appreciation.
  3. **Value Investing** : Value investing involves selecting stocks that appear undervalued. Value investors look for stocks that they believe are priced lower than their intrinsic value and wait for the market to recognize their true worth.
  4. **Income Investing** : This strategy emphasizes stocks that pay regular dividends. It’s suitable for those seeking a steady income stream from their investments.


While stocks can be classified in several ways, two of the most common are by market capitalization and sector. Market cap refers to the total market value of a company’s outstanding shares and is calculated by multiplying these shares by the current market price of one share. 
Large-cap companies are generally regarded as those with a market capitalization of $10 billion or more, while mid-cap companies are those with a market capitalization of $2 billion to $10 billion. Small-cap companies fall in the $250 million to $2 billion range.13
The industry standard for stock classification by sector is the [Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)], which was developed by MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices in 1999 as an efficient tool to capture the breadth, depth, and evolution of industry sectors. GICS is a four-tiered industry classification system that consists of 11 sectors and 24 industry groups. The 11 sectors are:14
  * Energy
  * Materials
  * Industrials
  * Consumer discretionary
  * Consumer staples
  * Healthcare
  * Financials
  * Information technology
  * Communication services
  * Utilities
  * Real estate


This sector classification makes it easier for investors to tailor their [portfolios] to their risk tolerance and investment preference. Conservative investors with income needs may weigh their portfolios toward sectors with constituent stocks that have better price stability. They may also look for attractive dividends through so-called defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. Aggressive investors may prefer more volatile sectors like information technology, financials, and energy. 
###  Choose a Broker 
Brokers act as intermediaries between you and the stock market, facilitating the purchase and sale of securities. Today, it is quite easy to open a new account at a broker, or to transfer an existing brokerage account to someplace new. Often, accounts can be opened up online and funded within minutes. Here are different types of brokers to consider: 
  1. **Full-Service Brokers** : [Full-service brokers] offer a wide range of services, including investment advice, retirement planning, tax guidance, and portfolio management. They typically charge higher fees but provide personalized service and expert advice. Examples include Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.
  2. **Discount Brokers** : Discount brokers offer fewer services compared to full-service brokers but charge lower fees. They provide basic trading services, research tools, and customer support. This option is suitable for self-directed investors who prefer to make their own investment decisions. Examples include Charles Schwab and Fidelity.
  3. **Online Brokers** : These brokers operate primarily through online platforms, offering a convenient and cost-effective way to trade stocks. They provide a range of tools and resources for self-directed investors. Online brokers often have lower fees compared to traditional brokers and may even offer commission-free trading. Examples include E*TRADE and Robinhood.
  4. **Roboadvisors** : [Roboadvisors] use algorithms to create and manage investment portfolios based on risk tolerances and goals. They offer a hands-off approach to investing with lower fees compared to human advisors. Roboadvisors are ideal for investors seeking a simple and automated investment solution.15 Examples include Betterment and Wealthfront.
  5. **Direct Stock Purchase Plans (DSPPs)** : Some companies offer DSPPs, allowing investors to purchase shares directly from the company without using a broker. These plans often have lower fees and can be a cost-effective way to invest in specific companies.


###  Diversify Your Portfolio 
Diversification is a key principle in risk management. By spreading your investments across various asset classes, industries, and geographic regions, you can reduce the impact of any single investment's poor performance on your overall portfolio. Diversification can be achieved through: 
  * **Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)** : These funds pool money from many investors to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks and other securities.
  * **Index Funds** : These funds aim to replicate the performance of a specific index, such as the S&P 500, providing broad market exposure (many of these funds are mutual funds and ETFs).
  * **Individual Stocks** : You can build a diversified portfolio by carefully selecting stocks from different sectors and industries.


###  Monitor and Adjust Your Investments 
Regularly monitoring your investments is essential to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance. Over time, market conditions and personal circumstances change, and your portfolio may need rebalancing. Rebalancing involves adjusting your portfolio back to its original asset allocation by purchasing or selling investments. This helps maintain your desired level of risk and ensures that your investment strategy remains on track. 
##  Other Kinds of Asset Markets 
While the stock market is one of the most well-known avenues for investing, there are several other asset markets that offer different opportunities and risks. Diversifying investments across various asset classes can help manage risk and potentially enhance returns. Here are some other important asset markets to consider. 
###  Bond Markets 
The [bond market], also called the fixed-income market, involves buying and selling debt securities. Bonds are essentially loans made by investors to corporations, municipalities, or governments in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the principal at maturity. The bond market is often seen as a safer investment compared to stocks, as bonds typically offer more stable and predictable returns. 
###  Real Estate Markets 
Real estate markets involve buying, selling, and leasing properties. It includes residential, commercial, and industrial real estate. Real estate can be an attractive investment due to its potential for capital appreciation, rental income, and portfolio diversification. Investors can participate in real estate markets through direct ownership of properties or indirectly via real estate investment trusts (REITs) that own, operate, or finance income-producing real estate. 
###  Commodities Markets 
Commodities markets involve trading raw materials and primary agricultural products. Commodities can be divided into two main categories: hard and soft. Hard commodities include natural resources like gold, silver, oil, and natural gas, while soft commodities include agricultural products like wheat, coffee, and cotton. Investors can access commodities markets through spot markets for physical goods, as well as futures markets that trade contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a predetermined price at a specific future date. 
###  Foreign Exchange Markets 
The foreign exchange ([forex]) market is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, involving currency trading. Investors and institutions trade currencies to profit from fluctuations in exchange rates. The forex market operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, and is influenced by economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market speculation. Key participants in the forex market include banks, hedge funds, corporations, and individual traders. 
###  Cryptocurrency Markets 
A newer entrant is the cryptocurrency market, which involves the trading of digital or virtual currencies or tokens that use cryptography for security and are decentralized through [blockchains]. Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple are among the most well-known cryptocurrencies. These markets are still highly volatile and speculative, offering the potential for significant gains and losses. Investors can participate through direct ownership of cryptocurrencies or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). They can also invest indirectly via cryptocurrency ETFs, which hold crypto or are linked to crypto futures. 
Another option is to purchase a cryptocurrency issued by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which, in addition to potential capital appreciation, gives the holder governance rights within the organization. 
## How Does Inflation Affect the Stock Market?
Inflation refers to an increase in consumer prices, either due to an oversupply of money or a shortage of consumer goods. The effects of inflation on the stock market are unpredictable—in some cases, it can lead to higher share prices due to more money entering the market and increased job growth. However, higher input prices can also restrict corporate earnings, causing profits to fall. Overall, value stocks tend to perform better than growth stocks in times of high inflation.
## How Much Does the Stock Market Grow Every Year?
The S&P 500 has [grown] about 10.5% per year since it was established in the 1920s. Using this as a barometer for market growth, one can estimate that the stock market grows in value by about the same amount each year. However, there is an element of probability—in some years, the stock market sees greater growth; in other years, it grows less. In addition, some stocks grow faster than others.
## What Is the Bid-Ask Spread in Stocks?
The bid-ask or bid-offer spread, the difference between the bid price for a stock and its ask or offer price, represents the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay or bid for a stock and the lowest price at which a seller is offering the stock. If the spread is tight, then the market in the stock is likely quite liquid. Meanwhile, if the bid-ask spread is wide, the stock is illiquid and harder to trade.
## How Do People Lose Money in the Stock Market?
Most people who lose money in the stock market do so through reckless investments in high-risk securities. Although these can score high returns if they are successful, they are just as likely to lose money. There is also an element of psychology: An investor who sells during a crash will lock in their losses, while those who hold their stock have a chance of seeing their patience rewarded. Finally, margin trading can make the stock market even riskier, by magnifying one’s potential gains or losses.
## Why Might a Company Choose Not to List on a Stock Exchange?
There are significant costs associated with listing on an exchange, such as listing fees and higher costs associated with compliance and reporting. There are also burdensome regulations and disclosure requirements that may constrict a company’s ability to do business. This is why most companies choose to list on an exchange at a later, more mature stage.
##  The Bottom Line 
Stock markets represent the heartbeat of the market, and experts often use stock prices as a barometer of economic health. But the importance of stock markets goes beyond mere speculation. They provide a structured and regulated environment where companies can raise capital to fund innovation, expansion, and operations, thereby driving economic growth. Exchanges also enable investors to buy and sell securities, facilitating liquidity and price discovery, which helps ensure that capital is allocated efficiently. 
Additionally, stock exchanges promote corporate transparency and accountability, as listed companies must adhere to strict disclosure requirements. By reflecting investor sentiment and broader economic trends, stock exchanges serve as crucial economic indicators, helping policymakers and analysts gauge the health of the economy. In essence, stock exchanges underpin the financial system, supporting both corporate development and investor engagement, which are essential for economic stability and progress.

When will the next bear market happen—and when it does, how long will it take to recover?
Stocks were approaching bear market territory as recently as Monday, April 7, and forecasters across Wall Street were raising the odds of a recession happening in 2025. It took the US stock market 18 months to recover from its most recent bear market—the downturn of December 2021, which was spurred by the Russia-Ukraine war, intense inflation, and supply shortages.
On the other hand, the covid downturn of March 2020 was a much faster cycle. Though the initial drop was dramatic, the market ultimately recovered in just four months—the fastest recovery of any market crash over the past 150 years.
So, what have we learned from these recent crashes?
  1. It’s impossible to predict how long a stock market recovery will take.
  2. If you don’t panic and sell your stock holdings when the market crashes, you will be rewarded in the long run.


These lessons also ring true when it comes to all other historical market crashes: Though they had varying lengths and levels of severity, the market always recovered and went on to new highs.
Here’s what we’ve learned from the market declines of the past 150 years.
## How Frequent Are Market Crashes?
The number of market crashes depends on how far back we go in history and how we identify them.
Here, we turn to data that former Morningstar Director of Research Paul Kaplan compiled for the book _Insights into the Global Financial Crisis._ Kaplan’s data includes monthly US stock market returns going back to January 1886 and annual returns over the period from 1871-1885.
In the chart below, each bear-market episode is indicated with a horizontal line, which starts at the episode’s peak cumulative value and ends when the cumulative value recovers to the previous peak. (Note that we use the term “market crash” interchangeably with bear market, which is generally defined as a decline of 20% or more. Also note that because this chart is informed by Consumer Price Index data, it does not fully reflect the most recent market movements. Still, the long-term trends hold.)
When you incorporate the effect of inflation, one dollar (in 1870 US dollars) invested in a hypothetical US stock market index in 1871 would have grown to $28,916 by the end of March 2025.
The substantial growth of that $1 highlights the enormous benefits of staying invested for the long term.
Still, it was far from a steady increase over that period. There were 19 market crashes along the way, with varying levels of severity. Some of the most severe market crashes have included:
  * **The Great Depression** , which began with the crash of 1929. This 79% stock market loss was the worst drop of the past 150 years.
  * **The Lost Decade** , which included both the dot-com bubble burst and the Great Recession. Though the market began recovering after the dot-com bubble burst, it didn’t climb back to its previous level before the crash of 2007-09. It didn’t reach that level until May 2013—more than 12 years after the initial crash. This period, the second-worst drop of the past 150 years, ultimately included a stock market loss of 54%.
  * **Inflation, Vietnam, and Watergate** , which began in early 1973 and ultimately led to a stock market decline of 51.9%. Factors that contributed to this bear market include civil unrest related to the war in Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, in addition to high inflation from the OPEC oil embargo. This market downturn is particularly relevant to today’s environment, given issues like the recent inflation surge and the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars.


These examples demonstrate the frequency of market crashes. Though these events are significant at the moment, they are indeed regularly occurring events that happen approximately once a decade.
> What does this history tell us about navigating volatile markets? Mainly, that they’re worth navigating.
## How to Measure the Pain of a Market Crash
How do you evaluate a market crash’s severity? That’s what Kaplan’s “pain index” measures. This framework considers both the degree of the decline and how long it took to get back to the prior level of cumulative value.
Here’s how it works: The pain index is the ratio of the area between the cumulative value line and the peak-to-recovery line, compared with that area for the worst market decline since 1870. That is, the crash of 1929/first part of the Great Depression has a pain index of 100%, and the other market crashes’ percentages represent how closely they matched that level of severity.
For example, consider that the market suffered a 22.8% drop around the Cuban missile crisis. The crash of 1929 led to a 79% drop, which is 3.5 times greater. That’s already significant, but also consider that the market took four and a half years to recover after that trough, while it took less than a year to recover after the trough of the Cuban missile crisis. So, taking this time frame into account, the pain index conveys that the first part of the Great Depression was 28.2 times worse than the Cuban missile crisis downturn.
The table below lists the bear markets of the past 150 years, sorted by the severity of market decline, and including its pain index.
As you can see, the market downturn of December 2021 (resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war, intense inflation, and supply shortages) ranks 11th on this list. By comparing this market crash to the other ones on the table, we see that the 28.5% stock market decline over that nine-month period was more painful for the stock market than the Cuban missile crisis and several downturns of the late 1800s/early 1900s.
And the covid crash of March 2020 was actually the least painful of these 19 crashes, due to the quick subsequent recovery. Though the downturn was sharp and severe (a 19.6% decline over roughly a month), the stock market ultimately recovered to its previous level a mere four months later.
## 5 Most Severe Market Crashes of the Past 150 Years
To better evaluate the impact of some of the most severe downturns of the past 150 years, let’s follow the path of $100 at the beginning of each market crash.
  * **World War I and Influenza**. After peaking in June 1911, markets soon started falling due to the breakups of conglomerates like the Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company—and the worst part of this downturn began when World War I broke out in July 1914. The stock market continued to decline over the next few years (bringing that $100 investment down to a value of $49.04) and didn’t recover until after the 1918 influenza pandemic.
  * **1929 Crash and Great Depression.** If you invested $100 in the stock market at the time of the 1929 crash, it would have declined in value to $21 by May 1932. This crash occurred when the post-World War I economic boom (which led to overconfidence, overspending, and overinflation of prices) was eventually no longer sustainable—a downturn from which the market took more than four years to recover.
  * **Great Depression and World War II.** The recovery from the first part of the Great Depression didn’t last long. Though the stock market recovered to its 1929 high by November 1936 (meaning that our investment had recovered to its $100 value, and even slightly ticked up to $100.23), it started declining again in February 1937. This next decline was largely owed to President Franklin Roosevelt’s changes in fiscal policy, including factors like the contraction in banks’ reserve levels and the Social Security tax, which compounded with the impact of World War II. The investment sank to $52.49 in March 1938, and eventually recovered to $104.88 by February 1945.
  * **Inflation, Vietnam, and Watergate.** In 1973, Middle Eastern members of OPEC imposed an oil embargo on the US, which led to severe inflation. On top of turmoil around the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam and political uncertainty after the Watergate scandal, this period saw a 51.9% stock market decline—which would have brought a $100 investment down to $48.13. It took more than nine years to recover from this downturn.
  * **Lost Decade (Dot-Com Bust and Global Financial Crisis).** The dot-com bust began when overinflated prices in Internet and technology companies hit a breaking point, losing nearly all the gains they had previously made. A $100 investment in August 2000 would have declined in value to $52.76. Seven years later, the stock market had almost gotten back to its previous level ($95.25) when the housing bubble burst and mortgage-backed securities began experiencing losses, leading to the Great Recession (in which the investment declined in value to $46). Altogether, this 12-year period included a 54% decline.


The market ultimately recovered from the Great Recession in May 2013, but still to come was the covid market crash and the downturn of late 2021.
There were also several shorter, less severe market declines over these 150 years. Consider the Rich Man’s Panic, caused by President Theodore Roosevelt’s attempt to break up large companies. Or the Baring Brothers Crisis: Barings Bank’s numerous investments in Argentina suffered when the nation faced a coup in 1891.
Yet even with those blips along the way, $100 invested at the beginning of the new millennium would be worth nearly $300 as of March 2025. If that $100 had been invested back in 1870, it would be worth $2,891,600 today.
## Lessons Learned About Navigating Stock Market Volatility
So, what does this history tell us about navigating volatile markets? Mainly, that they’re worth navigating.
The markets recovered after their stressful period in 2022—just as they did after a 79% decline in the early 1930s. And that’s the point: Market crashes always feel scary when they happen, but there’s no way to know right now whether we’re encountering a minor correction or looking down the barrel of the next Great Depression.
Still, even if you are looking down the barrel of the next Great Depression, history shows us that the market eventually recovers.
But since the path to recovery is so uncertain, the best way to be prepared is by owning a well-diversified portfolio that fits your time horizon and risk tolerance. Investors who stay invested in the market in the long run will reap rewards that make the turmoil worthwhile.

Stocks mostly rose on Monday as investors welcomed the absence of further trade war escalation over the weekend and as countries seek to temper US President Donald Trump's tariffs.
Markets started Monday on a tepid note after a much-needed positive run-up last week, with eyes on the upcoming earnings season and key economic data.
"A weekend light on drama was just what the doctor ordered for financial markets," said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
Analysts said that market sentiment has calmed since Trump dialled down pressure on Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell and hinted at progress in trade talks with economic partners.
"While last week's market action and today's early session suggest calmer waters, any sense of security is precarious," said City Index and analyst Fawad Razaqzada.
"Underneath the surface, key risks persist -- trade tensions, recession worries, and monetary policy uncertainties are very much alive."
And while developments regarding trade tensions could shift market sentiment this week, investors will have plenty of corporate earnings and economic data to command their attention.
"This week will be the first for a while where data and earnings will compete with tariff headlines," said Jim Reid, global head of macro research at Deutsche Bank. 
US giants Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft all report their first quarter earnings this week, with investors looking to assess the impact of tariffs on businesses. 
Eyes will also be on the release of several closely-watched US economic indicators which "may either dampen or revive concerns about recession in the world's largest economy," Mould added.
Asian markets enjoyed a largely healthy start after a strong end to last week on Wall Street and European stocks were higher in afternoon trading.
Wall Street's main indices opened higher, but the tech heavy Nasdaq slipped into the red.
The more positive mood weighed on gold, which hit a record high around $3,500 last week as investors flocked to safe havens.
Traders are hoping governments can hammer out deals with Trump to soften the impact of his sweeping tariffs, with reports last week saying China was considering exempting some US goods from its hefty retaliatory measures.
Beijing has said there are no active negotiations between the economic superpowers and on Monday an official denied Trump's claims to have spoken with Xi by phone.
In Beijing, senior economic planner Zhao Chenxin said China was on the "right side of history" in its gruelling trade war with the United States.
Japanese media reported that a second round of trade talks in Washington was set for Thursday.
The discussions will be closely watched as a barometer for efforts by other countries seeking tariff relief.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said a trade "understanding" between South Korea and the United States could be reached by this week.

## In This Article: 
[ ARKK  -0.78% ]
[ ^FVX  -0.85% ]
[ GM  -0.06% ]
[ IPO  -0.91% ]
[ TSLA  -2.84% ]
Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre examines the market action heading into today's final trading hour, the sector action across industries, and the EV space.
### Video Transcript
JARED BLIKRE: In addition to the NASDAQ leading the way for the majors, the minor, Russell 2000, small-cap index, that is up 2% as well. Now I want to take a broader look at the S&P 500. This is a year-to-date chart on a candlestick basis. And we can see, we have been tracing out a range over the last week or so.
We kind of dipped below it yesterday. Call it a false breakdown potentially, but a break of this little range right here, let's call it 4450 to the upside and about 4390 to the downside, probably determines the next direction, major direction, for the market. Also want to show you what's happening in the bond market real quick.
30-year T-bond yield hit 3%. It's at 2.99% now. That is the highest in three years.
Now we want to take a look at some of our leaders in sector, sentiment leaders, and we have retail. XRT, that is in the forefront. That is up 3.8%. Close behind it is Homebuilders. Now that is after a report this morning on housing starts was much more bullish than anticipated.
So we're also seeing ARKK components up as well. IPO, regional banks, it is definitely risk on here. Now I too want to take-- excuse me, I do want to take a quick check of the EV space. Tesla is up 2%. GM up 3%. Lucid Motors up 4%. But the standout here is Plug Power. That's after announcing a deal with Walmart where they're going to be supplying 20 tons per day of liquefied green hydrogen. Guys.

# Stock markets closed for Good Friday as Wall Street is stuck in trade war doldrums
U.S. stock and bond markets will be closed on Friday.
ByELAINE KURTENBACH[![AP logo](https://cdn.abcotvs.net/abcotv/static/common/origins/origin-ap.png)]()

BANGKOK -- Asian shares were mostly higher in thin Good Friday trading after a bumpy ride on Wall Street, where the Dow industrials lost 1.3% as UnitedHealth shed more than a fifth of its value due to a weaker-than-expected profit report.
U.S. stock and bond markets will be closed on Friday for the Easter holiday. Regular trading will resume on Monday.
The markets will also be closed on May 26, for Memorial Day, as well as June 19 for Juneteenth and July 4 for Independence Day.
Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1% to 34,730.28, while the Kospi in South Korea rose 0.5% to 2,483.42.
Taiwan's Taiex gained 0.3% and regional tech companies advanced after global heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a profit for the latest quarter that matched analysts' expectations. Perhaps more importantly, it also said it hasn't seen a drop-off in activity from its customers because of President Donald Trump's trade war, as some other companies have suggested.
Still, the company known as TSMC was cautious. "While we have not seen any changes in our customers' behavior so far, uncertainties and risks from the potential impact from tariff policies exist," Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said. TSMC's stock that trades in the United States added 0.1% on Thursday.
The Shanghai Composite index fell 0.1% to 3,276.73. Bangkok's SET rose 0.6%.
Many other markets were closed Friday for holidays ahead of Easter.
On Thursday, the S&P 500 edged up by just 0.1%, even though three of every four stocks climbed in the index.
The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1% in a mostly steadier performance following its sell-off the day before.
Nvidia weighed on the market after sinking a second straight day following its disclosure that new export limits on chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. It sank 2.9% and was the second-heaviest weight on the S&P 500.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 527 points as insurer UnitedHealth Group fell 22.4%, its worst drop since 1998. The company cut its forecast for financial results this year and said its Medicare Advantage customers were getting more care than expected from doctors and outpatient services.
Stocks of companies in the oil-and-gas industry rallied after the price of crude recovered some of its sharp losses taken this month. Diamondback Energy jumped 5.7%, and Halliburton climbed 5.1%.
On Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained $2.18 to $64.01 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up $2.11 to $67.96 per barrel.
Oil trading was paused Friday for the Easter weekend.
U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war remains a source of deep uncertainty. Economists worry his use of sharp tariff hikes could cause a recession if fully implemented and left in place for a while.
Trump on Thursday offered some encouraging signals that negotiations with other countries could lead to lower tariffs. But that was countered by his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who reiterated Wednesday that the tariffs are larger than what the central bank was expecting and could slow the economy and reignite inflation.
The tariffs create a dilemma for the Fed. If it cuts interest rates to help encourage more borrowing and spending, that would push prices higher.
Trump criticized that stance Thursday, saying the Fed is "always TOO LATE AND WRONG." He also said, "Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!"
An independent Fed able to act without influence from the White House a primary reason the United States has a reputation as a safe place to invest. History suggests central banks with more autonomy tend to have economies with lower and more stable inflation.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.32% from 4.29% late Wednesday. It had been easing for much of this week, following a climb last week that raised concerns that Trump's trade war may be undermining confidence in U.S. investments as the world's safest.
Reports on the U.S. economy came in mixed. One said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected, suggesting the job market remains relatively solid. But a second report said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region unexpectedly flipped to contraction from growth.
In Europe on Thursday, indexes slipped 0.6% in France and 0.5% in Germany. The European Central Bank cut its main interest rate. That usually pushes stock prices higher, but investors had already been expecting the move.
Early Friday, the U.S. dollar bought 142.37 Japanese yen, down from 132.44 yen on Thursday. The euro rose to $1.1375 from $1.1367.
