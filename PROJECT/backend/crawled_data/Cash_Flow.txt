# 5 rules for managing small business cash flow
Cash flow management is vital for a growing business. Here are five rules to help you keep cash flow under control.
![An invoice and some cash]
## Get your invoicing right
Invoicing is part of good cash flow management. Once you've delivered a product or service, don't wait to invoice. That can hurt your cash flow and your business. You should get into the habit of sending invoices for payment quickly.
Consider sending invoices immediately, or on a daily basis, depending on the nature of your work. If you are providing a service, think about asking for a deposit upfront, or a payment part-way through. It’s a reasonable request.
A product or service that has been delivered is the closest thing your business has to cold, hard cash. The sooner you invoice your client, the sooner you'll receive payment.
## Five rules for managing your cash flow
Invoicing is only the start. To maintain a healthy cash flow, you need more than just strong revenue. You need to be able to collect that revenue too. Here are five rules for managing your cash flow and getting your invoices paid faster:
### 1. Keep your books accurate and up to date
Your cash flow is only as good as your accounting and reporting. Don't let this get out of hand. Make sure your accounting information is updated regularly. Then you can see the financial state of your business at a glance. To help with this, try using a cash flow projection template to project your future cash position.
### 2. Don't be too lenient with your customers
Be direct and fair without being a pushover. A clever but polite invoicing strategy will usually get you a long way. But don’t be afraid to take more formal action if you need to.
Keep a close watch on your accounts receivable turnover at all times. If it’s trending up, it might be time to step up your efforts at chasing payment. As receivables age, their quality goes down, so you should act sooner rather than later.
### 3. Keep your accounting simple
If you’re not confident with numbers, hire a professional accountant. Use accounting software analytics, so you always know your cash position. It will also help you forecast your cash flow for planning purposes.
For example, maybe you’re expecting a big order next month. How will you know if you'll have the working capital needed to expand payroll? Or be able to buy the necessary inventory? Many small business owners get caught out when a large opportunity turns up. To avoid this, it’s important to account for the opportunity cost of all business decisions. They are unable to take advantage of it due to a lack of cash. Don’t let that happen to your business.
What’s more, a reliable accounting system will help you track and report on key business metrics. These include accounts receivables aging, operating margins and inventory turnover. Using a cash flow statement template can help you keep a clear record of your[ Sign Up ] [ Login ]

### CASHFLOW Classic is the free online investing game that makes learning to invest fun.
We believe the best way to learn isn’t done reading textbooks or listening to lectures. We believe the best learning is accomplished by doing the real thing.
For example, if you want to learn how to ride a bike, reading a book or listening to a lecture won’t help very much. Sure, you can learn some high-level theory about balance, stability, and the structural integrity of the bike… but it won’t help you overcome your fears of falling down.
The only way to learn how to ride a bike is to go outside, hop on a bike and start to pedal.
Investing works the same way.
You can read books about investing or listen to podcasts from day traders or watch YouTube videos on how to use stock trading software...

# What is cash flow?
Cash flow tracks money coming in and going out of a business—money received like fees, investment income, or sales revenue and money spent like bills, payroll, or purchases. More money coming in than going out is positive cash flow, and a key indicator of business strength and growth potential.
## Why does cash flow matter to the health of a business?
Cash flow makes or break a business. Positive cash flow has quickly turned struggling startups into market leaders, while negative cash flow (more money going out than coming in) has made long-established companies file for bankruptcy just as quickly.
In fact, sustained, positive cash flow is so important to the operations, stability, and growth of a business, that it’s a more significant indicator of financial health than profitability. That’s because a business may show strong profits on an income statement but still struggle to manage cash effectively, making the business more prone to financial instability.
Maintaining a positive cash flow is crucial for a variety of reasons:
  * **Operational continuity** with the funds to keep the business running smoothly, maintaining supplier reliability, and meeting short and long-term financial obligations to operate without interruption
  * **Creditworthiness** to lenders and investors who view sustained, positive cash flow as a strong indicator of financial stability, successful repayment, and future financing opportunities
  * **Growth and expansion** by having the funds necessary for constant reinvestment in the business, including opening new locations, researching new innovations, or launching new products and services
  * **Risk mitigation** by having sufficient cash reserves to overcome unexpected expenses or market downturns, while at the same time preventing debts from piling up towards bankruptcy
  * **Financial decision making** by monitoring cash flow in real time to understand a constantly changing financial picture and make more informed choices about spending, financing, and investing


## What are the basics of modern cash flow management?
Cash flow management involves analyzing and optimizing the timely movement of cash into and out of a business, ensuring enough cash for daily operations as well as long-term needs and strategic objectives.
Cash flow management involves different departments and business functions, along with established best practices:
### Cash flow forecasting
These forecasts incorporate historical data, market trends, and business projections to predict future cash inflows and outflows on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. They help a company anticipate periods of cash surplus and deficit to inform strategic decisions and planning activities.
### Liquidity management
A company must maintain enough liquid assets—such as cash, money market accounts, securities, bonds, deposits, or accounts receivable—to cover daily expenses and unexpected costs. To prevent cash crunches, good liquidity management also requires an adequate cash reserve, as well as access to lines of credit and short-term loans as backup liquidity sources.
### Budgeting
The budgeting process incorporates revenue projections, expense estimates, capital expenditures, and other financial data into a detailed plan to help control costs and allocate resources efficiently. The process includes reporting on best-case and worst-case scenarios as an additional safeguard against unexpected cash shortfalls.
### Receivables and payables management
By focusing on efficient invoicing, prompt payment incentives, and robust follow-up of overdue accounts, companies speed the conversion of sales to cash. And by strategically adjusting payment terms and methods with suppliers and other creditors, companies ensure optimal cash outflows while maintaining good supplier relationships and discounts for timely payments.
### Inventory management
Excess stock ties up cash unnecessarily, while stock shortages limits cash inflows due to lost sales, so balancing inventory levels is a key cash flow management best practice. Keeping inventory levels balanced requires accurate demand forecasts, real-time inventory monitoring, and just-in-time inventory management to reduce holding costs.
## What’s in a cash flow statement?
A cash flow statement is like a detailed checkbook for a business, helping decision-makers quickly see what money is coming in and going out, so they manage money wisely and reduce financial risk. It summarizes the amount of cash and cash equivalents entering and leaving the business, so stakeholders have a clearer pictuHBS Online

## Basic Engineering Design for Natural Gas Processing Projects
2014, Natural Gas ProcessingAlireza Bahadori Ph.D.
### 14.20.1 Definition and computation of cash flow
Cash flow is basically either receipts of cash (cash inflow) or payments (cash outflow). For the purpose of financial planning and determination of the net cash returns of an investment, it is necessary to distinguish between the financial flow, which is related to financing of an investment, and cash flow (expenditures and revenues), representing the performance or operation of the project (operational cash flow).
Operational cash flow are shown (as discounted cash flow) in Table 14.7:
Table 14.7. Operational Cash Flow
Operational Cash Flow In| Operational Cash Flow Out  
---|---  
Revenues from selling of fixed assets| Increase in fixed assets, (investment)  
Recovery of salvage valves (end of project)| Increase in net working capital  
Revenues from decrease of net working capital| Operating costs (see note)aMarketing expenses  
Sales revenues| Production and distribution losses  
Other income due to plant operations| Corporate (income) taxes  
a
    Note: It should be noted that depreciation charges (costs) and interest payments are not classified among the operational cash outflows, because inclusion of depreciation of assets would provoke a double-counting of the costs to the project, since they are already accounted for as investment costs when capitalized in the balance. However, for accounting purposes (including taxation), assets are to be depreciated over the project lifetime. This is why the depreciation of assets is a cost item in the net income statement only and must be deducted from the annual total costs of products sold (production and marketing costs) when determining the annual cash outflows. Interest and any other costs of financing are also included for the computation of the yield or return on the total capital investment, because they are part of this total yield. However, interest on loans (but not net profits distributed) is a cost item in the net income statement.

## What is a cash flow statement?
A cash flow statement is an important tool used to manage finances by tracking the cash flow for an organization. This statement is one of the three key reports (with the income statement and the balance sheet) that help in determining a company’s performance. It is usually helpful for making cash forecast to enable short term planning.
The cash flow statement shows the source of cash and helps you monitor incoming and outgoing money. Incoming cash for a business comes from operating activities, investing activities and financial activities. The statement also informs about cash outflows, expenses paid for business activities and investment at a given point in time. The information that you get from the cash flow statement is beneficial for the management to take informed decisions for regulating business operations.
Companies generally aim for a positive cash flow for their business operations without which the company may have to borrow money to keep the business going.
## Importance of a cash flow statement
For a business to be successful, it should always have sufficient cash. This enables it to pay back bank loans, buy commodities, or invest to get profitable returns. A business is declared bankrupt if it doesn’t have enough cash to pay its debts. Here are some of the benefits of a cash flow statement:
  * **Gives details about spending:** A cash flow statement gives a clear understanding of the principal payments that the company makes to its creditors. It also shows transactions which are recorded in cash and not reflected in the other financial statements. These include purchases of items for inventory, extending credit to customers, and buying capital equipment.


  * **Helps maintain optimum cash balance:** A cash flow statement helps in maintaining the optimum level of cash on hand. It is important for the company to determine if too much of its cash is lying idle, or if there’s a shortage or excess of funds. If there is excess cash lying idle, then the business can use it to invest in shares or buy inventory. If there is a shortage of funds, the company can look for sources from where they can borrow funds to keep the business going.
  * **Helps you focus on generating cash:** Profit plays a key role in the growth of a company by generating cash. But there are several other ways to generate cash. For instance, when a company finds a way to pay less for equipment, it is actually generating cash. Every time it collects receivables from its customers quicker than usual, it is gaining cash.
  * **Useful for short-term planning:** A cash flow statement is an important tool for controlling cash flow. A successful busines[Skip to main content](#main)

# Cash Flow
## Your guide to cash flow
No business can afford to ignore its cash flow. Monitoring this is like monitoring your pulse – it’s a crucial health check for your business. Indeed, [more than a third of SMEs] cite issues with cash flow as a barrier to their growth.
It’s crucial to understand what your cash flow is, how to calculate it and how to use a statement to keep on top of things.
## What is cash flow?
Cash flow refers to the movement of money in and out of your business in terms of income and expenditure. Ideally, you want to have a positive cash flow – meaning that more money is coming in to the business than goes out. If you have a positive cash flow, your business will be able to settle its bills and invest in growth. A negative cash flow means you’ll need to find an alternative source of income to be able to pay off debts.

# What is cash flow?
## Cash flow (definition)
**Cash flow determines the ability of a business to pay its suppliers, employees, lenders and owners on time.**
Timing is very important to cash flow. The business must have sufficient cash when payments come due or else they risk defaulting. Even profitable businesses can have cash flow issues when faced with badly timed expenses.
A small business with cash flow issues will struggle to make regular payments to its owners. This can, in turn, put their personal finances at risk.
### What affects cash flow
The amount of cash in the business is driven by three things:
  1. Operations – money from selling products and services, minus the expense of delivering those products and services 
  2. Investments – money spent on big assets like real estate or equipment, offset by money received when reselling similar big ticket items
  3. Finance – money received as loans, offset by money repaid to banks. Shareholder investments are also captured here, and these are offset by dividend payments. 


Ideally, cash flow most commonly comes from operations. It isn’t sustainable to keep taking loans or selling chunks of the business.
### How to measure cash flow
When assessing cash flow, a business can look forward by doing a cash flow forecast, or backward by doing a cash flow statement.
### Cash flow forecasts or projections
A cash flow forecast plots upcoming income and expenses on a timeline to predict how much money a business will have in the future.
![A dashboard shows how a business’s cash flow projection changes in response to income and expenses.](https://www.xero.com/content/dam/xero/pilot-images/features/analytics/analytics-video-placeholder.1646877481108.jpg)
Small businesses can get a picture of future cash flow by accounting for upcoming bills and payments (example from Xero dashboard).
### Cash flow statements 
A cash flow statement reviews the past month, quarter, or year to show how cash was generated and how it was spent. At the highest level, it will show which proportion of cash came from:
  * selling goods and services (operations)
  * taking loans or selling shares in the business (finance)
  * selling assets like machinery or real estate (investing)


This can help you check that cash flows are sustainable and not overly reliant on borrowing.
### Importance of cash flow
A business needs good cash flow to pay bills and keep trading. Having spare cash also gives a business the opportunity to pursue new opportunities, in line with the adage that you have to spend money to make money. Equally importantly, good cash flow alleviates a lot of financial stress for business owners and managers. 
### A quick note on the meaning of ‘cash’
Cash is not just money in the till or bank. It includes ‘cash equivalents,’ which is anything that can be sold for a known price, at short notice (usually within about 3 months).
### How cash flow differs from free cash flow, working capital, and liquidity
Cash flow is a measure of spending power, similar to free cash flow, working capital, and liquidity. Each of these terms has its own complexities, but here’s roughly how they compare:
  * Cash flow refers to the general availability of cash 
  * Liquidity shows how easily a business can cover upcoming costs (expressed as a ratio)
  * Working capital shows how much money will be left after covering those upcoming costs 
  * Free cash flow is the amount of cash left after making capital investments

The 12-month cash flow statement is one of the three fundamental financial statements for a business. (The other two are the balance statement and the profit and loss statement.)
Like a checking account statement, the cash flow statement shows the money going into and out of your business. You'll include a cash flow statement in the financial section of your business plan. 
## What is in a Cash Flow Statement?
The cash flow statement includes:
  * **Cash received**. This might include income from sales, loan proceeds or interest income. You can estimate when you will get paid if you’ve already made sales or received orders.
  * **Cash paid out**. This includes inventory, other purchases, payroll, rent, utilities, taxes, and loan payments. (This cash flow statement template consists of a “pre-startup” column for cash paid out before the cash flow statement period begins.)


Subtract cash paid out from cash received, and you have your **cash position** for the end of the month.
## How to Use a Cash Flow Statement
For new and growing business owners, every dollar counts. Cash flow problems are a common cause of small business failure. Reviewing the company's cash flow statement regularly can help entrepreneurs avoid this fate. New and established business owners can use a cash flow projection to anticipate working capital needs and plan for upcoming expenses.
