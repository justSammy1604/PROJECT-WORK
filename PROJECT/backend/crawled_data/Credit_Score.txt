#  Understand, get, and improve your credit score
Learn how to get your credit score, how it is calculated, and what you can do to improve it. 
## What is a credit score?
A credit score is a number that creditors use to determine your credit behavior, including how likely you are to make payments on a loan.
Having a high credit score can make it easier to get a loan, rent an apartment, or lower your insurance rate. Learn how to get your credit score, how it is calculated, and what you can do to improve it.
## **How to get your credit score**
There are four main ways to get your credit score:
  * Check your credit or loan statements.
  * Talk to a credit or housing counselor.
  * Find a credit score service. 
  * Buy your score from one of the three major credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion.


[Learn more from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) about each method of obtaining your credit score.]
## **How your credit score is calculated**
The three major credit reporting agencies create credit reports which include a history of your credit, loans, and other financial information. These credit reports are used to calculate your credit score.
The information from your credit report that affects your score includes:
  * Payment history
  * Outstanding balances
  * Length of credit history
  * Applications for new credit accounts
  * Types of credit accounts (mortgages, car loans, credit cards)


## **Ways to improve your credit score**
Your credit history directly affects your credit score. If you want to improve your score, there are some things you can do, including:[ Skip to main content ]

# Your Credit History Explained
Your credit history tells businesses how you handle money and pay your bills. It’s important to know your credit history since it can affect whether you get a job, can rent an apartment, or get a credit card or loan — and how much you’ll have to pay to borrow money.
## What’s my credit history?
Your credit history describes how you use money. It shows things like:
  * how many loans and credit cards you have
  * how much money you owe
  * how long you’ve had credit
  * if you pay your bills on time


The three nationwide credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — collect this information and put it in your credit report.
Read **Checking Your Credit Report** to learn how to order your report for free.
## Why is my credit history important?
Your credit history tells businesses how you handle money and pay your bills. Your credit history can affect whether you get a job, can rent an apartment, or get a credit card or loan. It also affects how much you’ll have to pay in interest to borrow money.
Positive information helps your credit. Positive information includes things like paying your bills on time and having low credit card balances. Negative information, like paying bills late, hurts your credit.
## What if I don’t have a credit history?
You might not have a credit history if:
  * you’ve never had a credit card
  * you’ve never gotten a loan from a bank or credit union


Without a credit history, it can be harder to get a job, an apartment, or even a credit card.
To find out how to build a credit history, read **Improving Your Credit**.
## What’s a credit score?
A credit score is a number that’s based on your credit history. Each nationwide credit bureau creates a different score. Your credit score will usually range between 300 and 850.
It costs money to find out your credit score. Sometimes a company might say the score is free. But you might find that you signed up for a service that checks your credit for you[ Skip to main content ]

#  Does having multiple credit cards actually help your credit score - or just make things messier? 
[ General  ]
I’ve been working on building my credit over the past year, mostly by using one credit card responsibly. It has a $5,000 limit, and I pay it off in full every month, which has already helped my score go up a bit. I’m now wondering if adding a second card would give my credit an extra boost - or if it’s just going to make things more complicated than they need to be. 
I’ve read that having multiple accounts can help by increasing your total available credit and showing more credit history variety, but I’ve also seen people say it can backfire if you’re not careful. I recently managed to save about $3000 partly from a win on Stake, so that could cover any new card fees or minimum spends, but I’m still cautious about managing more than one account. I’d rather avoid anything that could lead to missing payments or accidentally overspending. 
For those of you who’ve opened multiple credit cards to build credit, did it actually help your score in a noticeable way? Are there specific types of cards that are better for this - like store cards, secured cards, or just another standard rewards card? 
And if you do use multiple cards, how do you keep track of everything without it becoming a headache? I’m trying to be proactive, but I also don’t want to overcomplicate things if the benefit is minor.

OLYMPIA – Bipartisan legislation to remove medical debt from credit score reporting in Washington state was signed into law by Gov. Bob Ferguson on Tuesday.
Senate Bill 5480, sponsored by Sen. Marcus Riccelli (D-Spokane), will protect Washington consumers by prohibiting collection agencies from reporting medical debt to credit agencies.

Joe Timmons (D-Bellingham), sponsor of the House companion legislation. “This will help so many people across the state get back on tThere is no text provided to clean.
