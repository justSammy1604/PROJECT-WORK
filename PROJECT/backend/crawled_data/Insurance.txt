#  How Medicare works with other insurance
If you have Medicare and other health insurance (like from a group health plan, retiree coverage, or Medicaid), each type of coverage is called a "payer."
The "primary payer" pays up to the limits of its coverage, then sends the rest of the balance to the "secondary payer." If the “secondary payer” doesn’t cover the remaining balance, you may be responsible for the rest of the costs. If your group health plan or retiree coverage is the secondary payer, you may need to [sign up for Medicare Part B] before they'll pay. This order of payment is called "coordination of benefits."

If the insurance company doesn't pay the claim promptly (usually within 120 days), your doctor or other provider may bill Medicare. Medicare may make a conditional payment to pay the bill, and then later recover any payments the primary payer should've made. What’s a conditional payment?

# Insurance
Nevada liability insurance is required on registered vehicles in Nevada and on public streets. There are no grace periods.
You must carry Nevada Evidence of Liability Insurance in the vehicle or on a mobile device.
![new]Classic vehicle insurance is now required on vehicles with certain plate styles. See [Classic Vehicle Plates].
## Skip the Trip!
There is no need to visit a DMV office for most insurance issues. Start with these services and read the instructions below.
  * [Check Your Registration and Insurance Status]
  * [Update Your Policy Information]
  * [Surrender Plates/Cancel Registration]


Cancel your registration _before_ you drop liability insurance for any reason!
![Car illustration with blue shield under blue umbrella]
## Got a DMV Notice?
It's important that you respond to mailed notices from the DMV, even if you are sure you have coverage or you have moved or sold the vehicle.
The DMV first mails a Verification Request if we can't verify coverage or it appears there is a lapse in coverage. You must respond within 15 days of the mailing date. If the DMV can confirm that you have had continuous coverage, the process ends.
If your coverage has actually lapsed or we cannot confirm coverage at all, the DMV will send a Certified Letter notifying you that your vehicle registration will be suspended. This will take effect 10 days after the date of mailing.
  * [**Verification Response**] - Use if your access code begins with **I**
  * [**Registration Reinstatement**] - Use if your access code begins with **R**


Motorists who have an actual lapse in coverage are subject to a registration suspension and reinstatement fees and penalties. See [Penalties and Reinstatement]. Even a one day lapse in coverage will result in a registration suspension. 
If your registration is suspended, you may not drive the vehicle on any public street. Nevada law enforcement officers are required to confiscate the license plates from a vehicle driven on a suspended registration. They may also impound the vehicle.
**Out-of-state insurance is not accepted**. Your policy must be written for Nevada.
### My registration is suspended but I don't have a notice
Have your license plate number or Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) ready and [contact NVLIVE]. We will provide the dates of any lapse in coverage and instructions for reinstatement.
You may wish to log into [MyDMV] to check your registration and insurance status, update your policy information and your address if necessary. Or, [Update Your Policy Information] without a MyDMV account.
### I have had insurance in effect continuously
**Out-of-state insurance is not accepted** and is considered a lapse.
  * Be sure to respond to the Verification Request. It indicates there is a problem in your insurance records. These are not sent randomly.
  * Do not visit a DMV office unless instructed to do so. Your insurance carrier(s) must send electronic records that show coverage for any dates in question.
  * Compare the Vehicle Identification Number on your vehicle to the Certificate of Registration and the Evidence of Insurance. They must match. The name on your registration and insurance must match.
  * [Contact NVLIVE] or your insurance agent. We can ask your carrier(s) to verify coverage.
  * You may wish to log into [MyDMV] to check your registration and insurance status, update your policy information and your address if necessary. Or, [Update Your Policy Information] without a MyDMV account.


### I sold my vehicle or moved out of Nevada
Please respond to the Verification Request or Certified Letter.
If you have sold the vehicle or registered it in another state, you are not required to reinstate or pay any fees or fines. An insurance suspension will not result in any criminal charges or arrest warrant. However, reinstatement penalties will[ Skip to main content ]
