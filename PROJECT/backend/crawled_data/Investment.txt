# Financial Navigating in the Current Economy: Ten Things to Consider Before You Make Investing Decisions
**Invest Wisely: An Introduction to Mutual Funds.** This publication explains the basics of mutual fund investing, how mutual funds work, what factors to consider before investing, and how to avoid common pitfalls. [/investor/pubs/inwsmf.htm] **Financial Navigating in the Current Economy: Ten Things to Consider Before You Make Investing Decisions** Given recent market events, you may be wondering whether you should make changes to your investment portfolio. The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy is concerned that some investors, including bargain hunters and mattress stuffers, are making rapid investment decisions without considering their long-term financial goals. While we can’t tell you how to manage your investment portfolio during a volatile market, we are issuing this Investor Alert to give you the tools to make an informed decision. Before you make any decision, consider these areas of importance: **1. Draw a personal financial roadmap.** Before you make any investing decision, sit down and take an honest look at your entire financial situation -- especially if you’ve never made a financial plan before.  The first step to successful investing is figuring out your goals and risk tolerance – either on your own or with the help of a financial professional. There is no guarantee that you’ll make money from your investments. But if you get the facts about saving and investing and follow through with an intelligent plan, you should be able to gain financial security over the years and enjoy the benefits of managing your money.  **2. Evaluate your comfort zone in taking on risk.** All investments involve some degree of risk. If you intend to purchase securities - such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds - it's important that you understand before you invest that you could lose some or all of your money. Unlike deposits at FDIC-insured banks and NCUA-insured credit unions, the money you invest in securities typically is not federally insured. You could lose your principal, which is the amount you've invested. That’s true even if you purchase your investments through a bank. The reward for taking on risk is the potential for a greater investment return. If you have a financial goal with a long time horizon, you are likely to make more money by carefully investing in asset categories with greater risk, like stocks or bonds, rather than restricting your investments to assets with less risk, like cash equivalents. On the other hand, investing solely in cash investments may be appropriate for short-term financial goals. The principal concern for individuals investing in cash equivalents is inflation risk, which is the risk that inflation will outpace and erode returns over time.  **Federally Insured Deposits at Banks and Credit Unions --** If you’re not sure if your deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, it’s easy to find out. For bank accounts, go to www.myfdicinsurance.gov. For credit union accounts, go to http://webapps.ncua.gov/Ins/. **3. Consider an appropriate mix of investments.** By including asset categories with investment returns that move up and down under different market conditions within a portfolio, an investor can help protect against significant losses. Historically, the returns of the three major asset categories – stocks, bonds, and cash – have not moved up and down at the same time. Market conditions that cause one asset category to do well often cause another asset category to have average or poor returns. By investing in more than one asset category, you’ll reduce the risk that you’ll lose money and your portfolio’s overall investment returns will have a smoother ride. If one asset category’s investment return falls, you’ll be in a position to counteract your losses in that asset category with better investment returns in another asset category.# Investing.com - Financial Markets Worldwide

For a complete compilation of Investment Adviser Firms currently registered with the SEC and states securities regulators, download the [ Investment Adviser Data]. 
You can search for an Investment Adviser firm on this website and view the registration or reporting form ("Form ADV") that the adviser filed. This website will also search FINRA's BrokerCheck system and indicate whether an entity is a Brokerage firm. Investment advisers file Form ADV to register with the SEC and/or the states. Some advisers that do not have to register with the SEC or the states ("Exempt Reporting Advisers") must nonetheless complete some of the questions in Form ADV for purposes of reporting to the SEC and/or the states. Form ADV contains information about an investment adviser and its business operations. Additionally, it contains disclosure about certain disciplinary events involving the adviser and its key personnel. 
You can also search for an individual investment adviser representative and view that individual's professional background and conduct, including current registrations, employment history, and disclosures about certain disciplinary events involving the individual. The information about investment adviser representatives that appears on this website is collected from individual Investment Adviser Representatives, Investment Adviser firm(s), and/or securities regulator(s) as part of the securities industry's registration and licensing process. Individuals that are Registered Representatives of a Brokerage firm that are listed in FINRA's BrokerCheck system will also appear in search results.
