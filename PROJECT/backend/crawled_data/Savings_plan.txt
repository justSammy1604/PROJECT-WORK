“I dream of giving my son a better life than I had. I struggled to pay for college, but we’re saving to make sure he doesn’t have to. That’s my dream for his college experience.” 
K. Decker, OCSP saver
“My son started saving with this program for his three children when they were very young. Today, with two children in college, this is by far the best available program in Oregon. If you have children, and want them to secure higher education, this is the plan.”
Don Larson, long-time Mayor of Seaside
“I enrolled both of my daughters in the Oregon College Savings Plan because education is very important to me. By saving now, I know that when they’re older they won’t have to worry about paying for school.”

#### Statement on Financial Markets – April 2025
As you may be aware, the financial markets have experienced significant volatility in recent days. Please remember that you should periodically assess and – only if appropriate – adjust your PA 529 Investment Plan investment choices, keeping in mind the following factors:
  * Time horizon - the length of time you can invest before you need to use your funds. 
  * Risk tolerance - how much potential for loss you can bear. 
  * Investment objectives - what are you saving for? In this case, higher education. 


In light of this current volatility, it is especially important to consider your time horizon and long-term investment objectives. If you feel you need advice on how to navigate these uncertain times, you should consult an investment or financial advisor.

Do you have financial goals? 
A savings plan is a systematic approach to setting aside money regularly to achieve your financial goals. It involves putting aside a portion of your income or funds towards savings on a consistent basis.
**Having a savings plan is important for several reasons:**
