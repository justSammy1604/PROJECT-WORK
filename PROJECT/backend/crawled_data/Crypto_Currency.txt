### Frequently Asked Questions
### What is crypto?
Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that operates on distributed ledger technology called a [blockchain]() and uses [cryptography]() for security. It is decentralized and operates independently of a central bank.Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not backed by a physical commodity or government, and their value is determined by market demand and supply. Cryptocurrencies can be used to buy goods and services, transfer funds, and trade in markets. Popular cryptocurrencies include [Bitcoin](), [Ethereum](), [Litecoin](), [Ripple](), and [Cronos]().Many cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are created through a process called [mining](), which involves solving complex mathematical equations to validate and record transactions on a blockchain. This mechanism is also called [Proof of Work (PoW)](). Another consensus mechanism that has increased in popularity — as it is more energy efficient — is [Proof of Stake (PoS)]().

### Cryptocurrency Risks 
##### Facts About Paying With Cryptocurrency
There are many ways that paying with cryptocurrency is different from paying with a credit card or other traditional payment methods.
  1. **Cryptocurrency payments do not come with legal protections.** Credit cards and debit cards have legal protections if something goes wrong. For example, if you need to dispute a purchase, your credit card company has a process to help you get your money back. Cryptocurrencies typically do not come with any such protections.
  2. **Cryptocurrency payments typically are not reversible.** Once you pay with cryptocurrency, you can usually only get your money bac[Skip to main content] [Skip to search box]

## What is crypto? 
Crypto has grown rapidly in the last few years, accompanied by a surge in speculative trading – which means people trading just because they have heard it may rise in value, rather than seeing evidence to support a potential rise. 
Crypto can be thought of as ‘digital representations of value or rights’ that are secured by encryption and typically use some type of ‘distributed ledger technology’ (DLT). DLT allows data to be recorded and stored across a network of participants. This keeps the data secure, and means there is no one single central data storage point or one central authority that grants participants permission to access and participate in the network.
[ Distributed ledger technology  ]
At its simplest, DLT is a system for storing and managing information distributed across participants in a network. The type of DLT cryptoassets typically use is called a blockchain because the information is stored in blocks linked by cryptographic (basically complex mathematical processes) techniques.

# How Does Cryptocurrency Work? A Beginner's Guide
Written by Coursera Staff • Updated on Apr 10, 2025
Learn what cryptocurrency is, how it works, how to buy, sell, and trade it, and what you need to know before you get started.
![[Featured image] A crypto investor is studying the cryptocurrency market on their computer. ]
Cryptocurrency is digital currency that doesn’t require a central bank or financial institution to verify transactions. Instead, this virtual currency is verified and recorded with [blockchain technology], creating an unchangeable ledger that tracks trades and the purchase of digital assets. Although the first cryptocurrency emerged in 1990, the buzz surrounding cryptocurrency exchange has exploded in recent years. Despite the opportunities, market volatility reminds us to consider the risk involved in cryptocurrency trading. Whether you're interested in virtual currency for your career or to invest, understanding how cryptocurrency works is an essential first step. Learn more about cryptocurrency exchange, the [crypto market], environmental impacts, and popular cryptocurrencies in the following article. 
**Looking to invest in these financial assets?** Learn how the technology works and how to **screen out risky investment opportunities** in as little as **four months** with Duke University's online program, [Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The Future of Finance]. 
## What is cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrency, or crypto, is a form of digital payment. Unlike traditional currency which represents physical money, cryptocurrencies are purely digital assets. Although people use it primarily for online transactions, you can sometimes use it to purchase physical assets. While traditional payment methods are regulated by central banks and the government, cryptocurrency is decentralized, meaning it isn't controlled by one central authority. 
## How does cryptocurrency work?
Cryptocurrencies are based on [blockchain] technology, making them very secure, although it’s still up to investors to choose trustworthy exchanges. Cryptographic techniques ([the process of writing and deciphering code]) are used to issue, verify, and secure transactions. Through public ledgers, transactions remain traceable and unable to be counterfeited. This peer-to-peer digital asset system makes it fast, easy, and inexpensive to send and receive payments worldwide. There's no currency exchange needed, nor are there hefty fees. Transactions using these financial assets are publicly recorded, stored digitally, and transmitted via [encryption][ Skip to main content ]

# The Crypto-Currency

It’s not clear if bitcoin is legal, but there is no company in control and no one to arrest.Illustration by Grafilu
There are lots of ways to make money: You can earn it, find it, counterfeit it, steal it. Or, if you’re Satoshi Nakamoto, a preternaturally talented computer coder, you can invent it. That’s what he did on the evening of January 3, 2009, when he pressed a button on his keyboard and created a new currency called bitcoin. It was all bit and no coin. There was no paper, copper, or silver—just thirty-one thousand lines of code and an announcement on the Internet.
Nakamoto, who claimed to be a thirty-six-year-old Japanese man, said he had spent more than a year writing the software, driven in part by anger over the recent financial crisis. He wanted to create a currency that was impervious to unpredictable monetary policies as well as to the predations of bankers and politicians. Nakamoto’s invention was controlled entirely by software, which would release a total of twenty-one million bitcoins, almost all of them over the next twenty years. Every ten minutes or so, coins would be distributed through a process that resembled a lottery. Miners—people seeking the coins—would play the lottery again and again; the fastest computer would win the most money.
Interest in Nakamoto’s invention built steadily. More and more people dedicated their computers to the lottery, and forty-four exchanges popped up, allowing anyone with bitcoins to trade them for official currencies like dollars or euros. Creative computer engineers could mine for bitcoins; anyone could buy them. At first, a single bitcoin was valued at less than a penny. But merchants gradually began to accept bitcoins, and at the end of 2010 their value began to appreciate rapidly. By June of 2011, a bitcoin was worth more than twenty-nine dollars. Market gyrations followed, and by September the exchange rate had fallen to five dollars. Still, with more than seven million bitcoins in circulation, Nakamoto had created thirty-five million dollars of value.
And yet Nakamoto himself was a cipher. Before the début of bitcoin, there was no record of any coder with that name. He used an e-mail address and a Web site that were untraceable. In 2009 and 2010, he wrote hundreds of posts in flawless English, and though he invited other software developers to help him improve the code, and corresponded with them, he never revealed a personal detail. Then, in April, 2011, he sent a note to a developer saying that he had “moved on to other things.” He has not been heard from since.
When Nakamoto disappeared, hundreds of people posted theories about his identity and whereabouts. Some wanted to know if he could be trusted. Might he have created the currency in order to hoard coins and cash out? “We can effeOops, something went wrong
