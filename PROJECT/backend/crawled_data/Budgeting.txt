## Why make a budget
A budget is a plan that helps you manage your money. It helps you figure out how much money you get, spend and save. Making a budget can help you balance your income with your savings and expenses. It guides your spending to help you reach your financial goals.
A budget is especially important if you:
* don't know where your money is going
* don't save regularly
* have problems paying off your debts
* feel overwhelmed by your finances
* feel like you’re not in control of your finances
* want to make the most of your money
* are planning for a major purchase or a life event


Making a budget can help you:
* set spending limits
* find ways to pay down your debts
* reduce costs and save more
* live within your means
* reduce financial stress
* have more money for things that are important to you
* feel in control of your finances


## What to consider before you make a budget
Take these simple steps before you make your budget.
### Think about your financial goals
Identify your short-term and long-term goals. Make saving for those goals part of your budget.
For example, goals may be:
Short-term goals:
* paying off your credit card
* reducing your weekly expenses
* starting to build an emergency fund


Long-term goals:
* paying off all of your debts
* saving to buy a home or[Skip to main content]

#  Work out your budget
This advice applies to England.  See advice for See advice for Northern Ireland, See advice for Scotland, See advice for Wales
Important
You should immediately contact your nearest Citizens Advice if you've received court papers, are facing eviction or are expecting bailiffs.
Use a budget planner tool to help you understand:
  * what you’re earning and spending
  * where you might be able to cut costs


## Before you start
The planner will be most useful if you give accurate figures. You can use rough figures if you just want a general idea of your budget.
Try to find your most recent:
  * bank statements
  * payslips
  * debit and credit card statements or bills
  * receipts for things you usually pay for in cash


Make sure you include all your expenses, for example money you spend on your partner or family.
## Use the budget planner
You can use the free budget planner on the MoneyHelper website.

#  Budgeting for Nonprofits

[Print this page]
A key component of financial sustainability is the commitment of board and staff to financial management that includes timely review of financial reports and advance planning. One way that board and staff plan for income and expenses in the future is by creating a budget. Approval of the annual budget is one of the fundamental building blocks of sound financial management.
For nonprofits with employees, creating the annual budget is usually staff’s responsibility, but board members often review the proposed budget and the full board typically adopts the budget at a full board meeting. The approved budget then serves as a guide for financial activity in the months ahead. Budgets should not be written in stone, because the financial position of the nonprofit may change during the year.
[ ![Indinero ad) ] _advertisement_
A budget is a  _guide_ that can help a nonprofit plan for the future as well as assess its current financial health. It is good practice to periodically review the budget as well as compare it to the actual cash flow and expenses, to determine whether they are playing out as expected during the course of the year. It may be necessary to amend the budget during the year.
Budgets may be requested by parties involved in financial transactions with the nonprofits, such as banks, or by donors/grantmakers considering a gift to the nonprofit.
## **Mythbuster**
Board members and staff who are new to the charitable nonprofit context may wonder, "_Does a nonprofit’s budget have to break even?" "Can there be a profit?_ "
  * In Should Your Budget Balance? No!, Kate Barr of Propel Nonprofits argues that break-even budgets are not only not required, but they are the biggest barrier to building reserves and ultimately a financially healthy organization.

## Thank you for your participation!
Vote Week has concluded. We are tallying the votes and are excited to share results with you later this spring!
## What is Participatory Budgeting?
Participatory Budgeting (PB) is a democratic process in which community members directly decide how to spend part of a public budget. The process began in Porto Alegre, Brazil in 1989. Today, there are more than 3,000 participatory budgeting processes around the world, most at the municipal level.
## What is PBNYC?
In 2011, four New York City Council Members – Brad Lander, Melissa Mark-Viverito, Eric Ulrich, and Jumaane D. Williams – launched a PB process to allow residents in their district to allocate part of their capital discretionary funds. Over the years, the process has grown to include Council Members across New York City, giving communities real decision-making on an annual basis.
Participatory Budgeting in New York City (PBNYC) plays an important role in giving communities the ability to directly impact the capital budgeting process. It motivates New Yorkers to engage the civic process and make decisions by sharing ideas, developing proposals, and voting on community projects.
This year, 24 Council Members across New York City are asking residents how to spend at least $24 million in capital funding, specifically for local improvements to schools, parks, libraries and other public spaces. PBNYC funds physical infrastructure projects in public spaces, cost at least $50,000 and have a lifespan of at least 5 years.
## How Does It Work?
#### Idea Collection
_October – November_ Through community meetings, residents brainstorm ideas and recruit volunteers (as known as “Budget Delegates”) for the current cycle.
#### Proposal Development
_December – February_ With support from City agencies and staff, ideas are transformed into tangible proposals. Budget Delegates then narrow down proposals and select projects that meet the needs of their community.
#### GOTV and Vote Week
_March – April_ Once final ballot projects have been determined, stakeholders get-out-the-vote (GOTV) and prepare for a nine-day districtwide vote, taking place between March 29-April 6, 2025.
#### Evaluation and Planning
_May – June_ Winning projects are included in the upcoming Fiscal Year budget in June. Staff and stakeholders evaluate the process and oversee the implementation of funded projects by City agencies.
