Most people identify trends by reading industry publications, talking to other professionals, and following influencers on social media.
**However, there a handful of untapped ways to find trends before they take off.**
In this guide we'll cover 6 actionable ways to identify trends early on.

### 1. Use a Trend Discovery Tool
One of the easiest ways to identify market trends is to use a trend discovery tool that tracks under-the-radar trends in your industry.
We built [Exploding Topics] specifically for this use case.
The flagship product is the Trends Database that you can filter by category (health, beauty, travel, pets, marketing, finance, etc.) and growth status (exploding, regular, and peaked) to find thousands of under-the-radar trends.
Each trend is a product, brand, or industry term, and you'll see a graph of that keyword's search volume trend over time to gauge consumer interest and future growth potential.
![undefined]
When you find an interesting trend, click "Track Topic" and add it to a Project.
Projects are personalized folders you can create to save and track trends over time. You can name Projects anything you like (e.g., "Exploding Pet Brands," "Peaked Travel Companies"), and they live inside the Exploding Topics dashboard so that you can easily monitor trends at a glance.
![undefined]
A key differentiator that sets Exploding Topics apart from most other trend discovery tools is the massive amounts of data we use to qualify trends![undefined]
The Trends Database is excellent for discovering new trends you've never heard of.
However, if you already know about a trend and want to gauge its growth potential and stability, you can type the keyword into the Trends Sea[ Subscribe To Newsletters ]

Staying ahead of market trends isn’t about gut feelings or hunches. It’s about identifying key shifts among consumers, and which ones are _worth_ pursuing before they reshape the landscape.
Market trend analysis helps executives and investors spot the next big trends before they peak, giving them a competitive edge in anticipating what’s next.
However, the quality of your market trend analysis process directly determines the value of your insights. Every step – whether it’s the data you rely on, the metrics you choose, or how you interpret your findings – plays a critical role in shaping how these trends will impact your strategy.
In this guide, we'll walk you through a straightforward and effective market trend analysis process that outlines:
  * Specific data points to identify
  * Quality resources to find data
  * How to use the insights you discover to inform your business strategy


### What is Market Trend Analysis?
Market trend analysis is a data-driven process that executives, investors, entrepreneurs, and other business professionals use to identify and assess market patterns to make informed strategic decisions.
For business leaders, market trend analysis provides insights they need to make sound strategic decisions about new features, product lines, and marketing campaigns to launch (or pivot).
For investors and entrepreneurs, market trend analysis provides insights that guide them toward the most profitable markets and businesses to invest in.
For example, if you’re an investor in the health food market, performing a market trend analysis would help you realize prebiotic soda is an emerging category worth digging into more.

### Why is Market Trend Analysis Important?
Here are the four main ways market trend analysis helps business executives, entrepreneurs, and investors make better strategic decisions.
#### **Identify Emerging Trends Early**
An effective market trend analysis process helps you identify emerging trends **before** they mature.
Spotting trends early is useful for investors as early investments often yield a higher ROI. For business leaders and entrepreneurs, this data gives a competitive edge and allows them to identify new product and service opportunities to meet future demand for their customers.
#### **Reduce Investment Risk**
Market trend analysis provides insight into market volatility and lets you gauge whether demand increases, decreases, or remains consistent.
This can help you identify the lowest risk opportunities or at least be aware of the risk associated with each investment decision.
#### **Improve Forecasting Accuracy**

# Palm Oil Market Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033 | New AI Monitoring Project in Indonesia Bolsters Palm Oil Crop Visibility
## The global palm oil market is projected to grow from USD 61.19 billion in 2024 to USD 88.84 billion by 2033, with a CAGR of 4.23% from 2025 to 2033. This growth is driven by the oil's versatility and cost-effectiveness, rising global demand, and increased interest in fortified and biofuel applications. Key markets include the US, UK, India, and Saudi Arabia, with significant focus on sustainable practices amid environmental concerns. Major players like Archer-Daniels-Midland and Wilmar International are pivotal in market dynamics.

Dublin, April 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Palm Oil Market Size and Share Analysis - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033" has been added to **ResearchAndMarkets.com's** offering.
The global palm oil market is projected to grow significantly, with expectations to reach USD 88.84 billion by 2033, up from USD 61.19 billion in 2024, at a CAGR of 4.23% from 2025 to 2033.
This growth is driven by the increasing versatility and applications of palm oil, rising population, economic development, and expanding middle-class presence in emerging markets. Its cost-effectiveness and health benefits awareness are also contributing factors.
The global palm oil industry is a crucial segment of the edible oils market, primarily led by Indonesia and Malaysia in Southeast Asia. Palm oil's high yield per hectare compared to other vegetable oils makes it favorable for global demand. The sector supports millions of jobs and is vital for the economies of these producer countries. However, the industry faces environmental and social criticism due to its contribution to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and greenhouse gas emissions.
Efforts like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) aim to certify palm oil production with minimal environmental and social impacts. Yet, fully implementing these sustainability practices across the supply chain remains challenging.
Recent developments include Dabeeo's AI monitoring initiative for Indonesian palm oil crops in collaboration with Tunas Sawa Erma Group, and 3F Oil Palm's establishment of India's first integrated oil palm processing unit in Arunachal Pradesh. These ventures highlight significant technological and infrastructural advancements in the industry.
Growth in the palm oil market is further propelled by increased interest in fortified palm oil, which contains essential vitamins like A and D. This shift aligns with growing consumer demand for healthier op[Skip to Main Content]

# Art Market Trends 2025

Welcome to Art Market Trends, Artsy’s new research-driven report on the key topics shaping the art industry and collecting in 2025.
Rather than looking into a single slice of the art market at a time, as we have done in the past, we constructed this report from two concurrent surveys—one sent to galleries and another sent to collectors—which together yielded insights from over 1,600 respondents from across more than 60 countries. 
The purpose of this report is to bridge these two pillars of the art market to generate a set of findings that holistically represent the current state of the market. Through our findings, we’re able to answer questions not just about galleries and collectors, but also about how they interact, such as whether the segments of the market that are most important to galleries are also the most desirable for collectors? Are digital-native collectors seeking out galleries with robust online sales operations? 
We focus on topics including the need for increased transparency in the art market, the categories of art that are viewed as the most important commercially, art pricing trends, sales strategies, and the role of online channels. 
What we have found overall is a nuanced picture of how collectors and galleries view each other. One key finding offers important context: Just 17% of collectors believe that the art market caters “very well” to them. Most collectors, we found, think art collecting would be easier with more transparent artwork pricing and information; a lack of transparency is viewed as a primary barrier to buying art online. But this sentiment is only partially matched by the galleries we surveyed: While most acknowledge that their collectors care about transparency, a minority say they took steps to improve it last year. 
We also found that, in a challenging economic environment, galleries are turning to digital channels to reach new collectors more effectively. More than half of galleries said that they are expanding their online channels in response to the challenges facing their businesses. Meanwhile, collectors use online platforms like Artsy and Instagram to discover new artists. This trend is particularly notable among young collectors, who most galleries are prioritizing in their outreach efforts. 
Below, we share a summary of the findings. To read the report in full, [click here to download the PDF].
