Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq sink with Trump's tariffs, Fed bashing in focus
Brett LoGiurato  and Ines Ferré
Updated Mon, April 21, 2025 at 7:31 PM GMT+5:30 2 min read

 ^IXIC  -2.47% 
 ES=F  -1.48% 
 YM=F  -1.38% 
 NQ=F  -1.72% 
US stocks fell sharply Monday as investors prepared for another week of developments on President Trump's fast-moving tariff policies and for the kickoff of Big Tech earnings reports, with Fed independence also looming as an emerging risk.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down over 1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) sank 1.4%, leading the way down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped 1%, over 350 points.

As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer wrote in our preview of the week, the stock market remains largely at the mercy of Trump's tariffs. Different headlines and shifts in narratives have driven big market swings over the past several weeks, with all three indexes down over 5% since Trump's "Liberation Day" event.
Read more: The latest on Trump's tariffs
Investors are also grappling with another emerging concern: Trump's bluster around removing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with whom Trump is unhappy for allegedly keeping interest rates too high. Trump's new focus on Powell comes after the Fed chief delivered a stark warning on the potential effects of tariffs on the economy.
The "sell-America" trade gathered more steam Monday, as the US dollar (DX=F) index eyed its lowest level since 2022 and the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) rose to near 4.4%.
Meanwhile, earnings season continues, with this week looming as pivotal. Two of the "Magnificent Seven" take the spotlight of some 120 S&P 500 companies reporting this week: Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Both stocks are emblematic of this year's shift away from the high-flying tech trade of recent years. Alphabet stock is down nearly 20% so far in 2025, while Tesla has lost a whopping 40%.
Tesla shares lost 4% in early trading on Monday. Another Magnificent Seven peer, Nvidia (NVDA), continued a recent slide, down 3% as China looks to domestic alternatives amid new US curbs on Nvidia's chip sales.
Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged to its highest level since Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements. Gold (GC=F) also reached another record, crossing the $3,400 level for the first time.

## Trump calls for Fed to lower interest rates 'NOW'
President Trump once again called for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in a post on Truth Social on Monday.
He warned of a "SLOWING" of the economy "unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW."
President Trump posted on Truth Social Monday morning doubling down on his opinion that the Federal Reserve should be cutting interest rates. 
Last week, reports swirled that Trump has been pursuing possibly firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell after Trump told reporters "If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me."
But investors have largely argued this wouldn't be a welcome a sign for markets, with even the possibility of Trump ousting Powell could be another headwind for stocks.
"If the independence of the Fed ... comes into question and is actually realized, I think that would further put downward pressure on the confidence that foreign investors have in investing in US dollar assets," Michael Goosay, Principal Asset Management's chief investment officer of global fixed income, told Yahoo Finance.

## Why your trip abroad is getting pricier
If you're planning a trip abroad this summer, the weak US dollar could put a dent in your travel budget.
On Monday, the US dollar (DX-Y.NYB) extended its decline, hitting its lowest point in three years against key global currencies. It's one of the worst starts to a year for the greenback in decades.
That means American travelers will have less spending power while on grand tours of European capitals this summer.
But a weak US dollar isn't all bad news. While travelers may feel the pinch, there's a silver lining for US businesses. Profits made overseas in euros, pounds, and yen are worth more when converted back into dollars, offering a financial boost for companies with international profits.

## Investors pour into European equity funds, flee US
As my colleague Ines Ferré noted below, the "sell America" theme is alive and well in markets amid heightened trade tensions and President Trump's heavy criticism of Fed Chair Powell.
Data from LSEG Lipper showed US equity funds and bond funds faced selling pressure in the week ended April 16 as tariffs revived recession fears.

## Stocks fall as Trump tariffs, criticism against Fed takes center stage
US stocks dropped on Monday as investors assessed the impact of President Trump’s tariff policy and criticism of the Federal Reserve on US assets.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down roughly 1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell about 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped over 200 points.
Tech stocks led the market lower on Monday, with all of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks in the red.
The US dollar (DX=F) index neared its lowest level since 2022, and the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) rose to near 4.4% as the "sell America" theme took center stage following President Trump's heightened criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering rates soon enough.

## Discover, Capital One stocks jump after lenders get key merger approvals
Discover (DFS) and Capital One (COF) stocks continued to gain on Monday morning after two bank regulators approved Capital One's $35 billion purchase of Discover.
Discover shares jumped more than 7% ahead of the opening bell while Capital One (COF) climbed 4%.
As Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith notes, Capital One's purchase of Discover would make it the biggest credit card issuer in the US by loan volume, even bigger than JPMorgan Chase (JPM).
The combined bank is expected to have consolidated assets of approximately $637.8 billion, making it the sixth-largest nationally chartered US bank, according to regulators.

## US stock futures accelerate losses
US stock futures took a leg lower Monday morning as investors await updates on tariffs and threats to Federal Reserve independence reemerged.
S&P 500 futures (ES=F) tumbled 1.4%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq (NQ=F) sank 1.58%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) dropped 1.2%, over 400 points. Losses have accelerated over the past hour.

Stock Market Sell-Off: 3 Growth Stocks That Are Absurdly Cheap
Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool 
Mon, April 21, 2025 at 4:45 PM GMT+5:30 6 min read
## In This Article:
 GOOG  -2.60% 
ADBE  -2.36% 
^GSPC  -1.93% 
TSM  -3.19% 
The recent stock market sell-off left nearly all stocks down from their all-time highs. However, some stocks were beaten down before the broader sell-off began, so they look unbelievably cheap now.
This opens up a massive buying opportunity for long-term investors, as it's not often that you can scoop up shares this cheap. Three stocks that look like absolute bargains right now are **Alphabet**(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), **Taiwan Semiconductor**(NYSE: TSM), and **Adobe**(NASDAQ: ADBE). All three of these companies are well off their highs, yet they don't have a good reason to be trading this cheaply.
_**Where to invest $1,000 right now?** Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the **10 best stocks** to buy right now. **Continue »**_
## The S&P 500 is the baseline for comparison
For my baseline of what I describe as "cheap," I'm using each stock's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This metric uses analysts' projections to determine the denominator. Those projections aren't perfect, but I think it's superior to the trailing P/E ratio because it looks at where the stock is going, rather than where it was. The market is a forward-looking entity, so the valuation metrics that we choose should follow that approach.
I'll use the **S &P** **500** 's forward P/E ratio of 20.2 as a baseline. If a stock is cheaper than this mark, then it can likely be considered somewhat of a bargain, as it's trading below the most common and broad index. This is already a conservative measure, as all three of these companies are tech giants that are likely better compared to the **Nasdaq-100** index, which has a forward P/E of 24. However, by using a more conservative index (the S&P 500), investors can have even more confidence that these stocks are on sale right now.
## Alphabet
Alphabet trades at 17.5 times forward earnings.

GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward)

GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.
Alphabet has long traded at a discount to its peers, mainly due to its dependence on advertising revenue. Ad revenue is cyclical and often falls in preparation for a recession or an economic downturn. Ad revenue is an easy place for companies to save money, and it's often the first casualty during budget cuts, which would clearly hurt Alphabet.
That's part of the reason Alphabet is so cheap right now. But even using the trailing P/E ratio, the price you're paying today is clearly historically low.

GOOGL PE Ratio

GOOGL PE Ratio data by YCharts.
We're approaching the lowest valuation point in the past decade, which occurred in early 2023 when the market was convinced that the U.S. was headed for a recession. Investors are in a similar mindset right now as they digest how tariffs will affect the economy.
Story Continues
Another factor investors must weigh is two court rulings that went against Alphabet. A U.S. district judge recently declared Google's digital ad network an illegal monopoly, adding to an earlier ruling that its search engine was also an illegal monopoly. This is far from the end of this saga, as Alphabet will appeal these rulings, and the Justice Department would need to devise remedies for Alphabet so that it isn't deemed an illegal monopoly. We're still years away from any resolution on this, but there's still a solid business to invest in here.
While I'm not sure how the rest of 2025 (or beyond) will shake out for Alphabet, it holds a dominant position in the advertising space (which got it into trouble with the U.S. government) with its Google family of products,. Even if the company is split up, the pieces that come from this breakup will be incredibly valuable and will likely create extra shareholder value. As a result, I think Alphabet can still be purchased right now.
## Adobe
Adobe used to be one of the most premium-valued big tech companies, but it no longer holds that spot. Investors are worried that various generative AI platforms will eat into Adobe's market share. We haven't seen this happen yet, and Adobe has hit back with its own generative AI models. Its growth has also remained fairly steady at around 10%, which leads me to believe it's still doing OK.
However, Adobe has lost the premium valuation that it traded at for a decade.

ADBE PE Ratio

ADBE PE Ratio data by YCharts.
Adobe's trailing P/E ratio has never been this low in the past decade, and the forward P/E is also well below the market's price. This looks like a rotation from Adobe being a growth company to being a value company, and scooping up shares during this transition is a smart long-term move for investors.
## Taiwan Semiconductor
Last is Taiwan Semi, a chip fabricator for many leading tech companies. Investors are worried about how its business will hold up with tariffs, but there are currently no tariffs on semiconductors, although there may be some in the coming months. Regardless, TSMC is already investing $100 billion to expand its U.S. manufacturing footprint, which will help keep the company in President Donald Trump's graces.
Even with that great news, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock trades at a significant discount to the market.

TSM PE Ratio

TSM PE Ratio data by YCharts.
We've seen Taiwan Semi's stock cheaper than this, but 17 times forward earnings is still a bargain for one of the world's most important companies. Taiwan Semiconductor's long-term growth trajectory is still fantastic, and I think the cheap stock price warrants investors scooping up the stock today.
## Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?
Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:
The _Motley Fool Stock Advisor_ analyst team just identified what they believe are the **10 best stocks** for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.
**Consider when**Netflix** made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,**you’d have $524,747**!* ****Or when**Nvidia** made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,**you’d have $622,041**!***
 **Now, it’s worth noting _Stock Advisor_ ’s total average return is792% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to153%for the S&P 500. Don’t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join _Stock Advisor_.**

## US stocks tumbled to kick off the week, with the S&P 500 losing 1.1%, the Nasdaq tumbling 1.5% and the Dow Jones falling more than 370 points, as traders returned from the long weekend to renewed concerns over the Fed’s independence. Market sentiment took a hit after President Trump called Chair Powell a “major loser” and called for an immediate reduction in interest rates. On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said President Trump is exploring the possibility of firing Fed Chair Powell. The remarks have intensified fears about the politicization of US monetary policy and the potential erosion of the Fed’s credibility. Meanwhile, investors continue to monitor trade tensions, with China warning countries about striking a deal with the US at its expense. Investors are also gearing up for a heavy week of corporate earnings, with Alphabet, Tesla, IBM, and Boeing among the key names reporting. Tech and consumer discretionary were the worst performers.
## The main stock market index in the United States (US500) decreased 696 points or 11.83% since the beginning of 2025, according to trading on a contract for difference (CFD) that tracks this benchmark index from United States. Historically, the United States Stock Market Index reached an all time high of 6152.87 in February of 2025. United States Stock Market Index - data, forecasts, historical chart - was last updated on April 21 of 2025.

Welcome back and hopefully you enjoyed the long weekend. As investors continued to digest the evolving trade backdrop last week was mixed in US markets. The S&P 500 fell 1.5% with continued weakness in mega-cap tech stocks. However, the equal weight version of the index and small and midcap indices ended with modest gains. Global markets also ended higher with European indices outperforming up 2.5% - 4%. The global outperformance and continued weakness in the USD continued to raise concerns about capital outflows.

## Two tariff scenarios and the impacts on key macroeconomic and market variables
> **Key Takeaways:**
>   * This past week, stock markets were modestly lower, with the S&P 500 down 1.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq down around 2.6%. For the full year, the S&P 500 is now down about 10.2%, while the Nasdaq is lower by around 15.7%.
>   * The move last week was driven once again by tariff uncertainty. New export restrictions on semiconductors to China put pressure on large U.S. semi companies like NVIDIA. In addition, Fed Chair Powell reiterated that the Fed is likely to remain patient on rate cuts, given that tariffs potentially weigh on both inflation and economic growth.
>   * Perhaps the good news was that the bond market last week functioned in a more orderly manner. As stocks fell, government bond yields moved lower, with the 10-year Treasury yield lower by about 0.16% this week alone, moving prices higher. The U.S. Agg bond index climbed about 1% for the week, providing some diversification benefit for balanced investors.
>   * Nonetheless, the broader markets continue to be driven by the tariff narrative in the near term. Below we outline two different tariff scenarios – one with a moderate escalation in tariffs and one with high tariff rates in place – and examine the impacts on key economic and market variables. Overall, even a moderately higher tariff regime will negatively impact both inflation and economic growth but perhaps can be offset by fiscal and monetary policy as we head toward 2026.
> 

### Scenario 1: Moderate Tariffs
The moderate-tariff scenario is currently the highest probability outcome, in our view. In this scenario, tariffs on most trading partners stay around 10%, with ongoing negotiations moving some rates and nontariff barriers lower. The tariffs on China and critical sectors like autos, steel and aluminum likely remain elevated; however, the negotiation between the U.S. and China is more productive and current tariff rates could move lower. Overall, average tariff rates in this scenario are still around 10% to 15% in the U.S.
**Economic growth and inflation:** In this scenario, we would expect core CPI inflation to rise to 3.5% to 4%, up from current levels of about 2.4%. We would expect inflation to gradually rise over the course of the next few months, as companies work down existing inventories and replenish these at higher post-tariff prices. However, while inflation may rise, we would expect it to peak this year and perhaps even move lower by next year, as yearly comparisons ease versus this year's rise in prices. This is similar to the inflation trend that the Fed outlined in its March 2025 meeting.

This chart shows FOMC inflation projections from the March 2025 meeting.
For economic growth, under a moderate tariff regime, we would expect the economy to slow, but growth would likely remain positive this year, as households continue to spend on goods and services, albeit at a softer pace. According to the 2018 Fed model, an increase in tariffs by 10% would imply a softening in growth of about 1.4 percentage points, indicating growth may moderate to around 1% annualized this year. While we may see a quarter of negative growth this year, we would not expect a recession in the U.S. in the year ahead.
**Federal Reserve:** The Federal Reserve continues to be caught between "a rock and a hard place" as it navigates potentially higher inflation and lower economic growth. The Fed has already told us that it plans to remain patient as the data unfolds. In our view, inflation is likely to rise first, followed by a more pronounced slowdown in consumer and corporate spending, and then potentially higher unemployment and softer labor markets – typically a lagging indicator.
The Fed may act when it starts to see elevated tariffs impact the hard data, like consumer spending and ultimately lower GDP growth and higher unemployment. Given these will likely emerge more so in the back half of the year, the Fed may be on hold until the second half of 2025. We would expect the Fed to cut rates perhaps two or three times this year in this scenario, in line with the two rate cuts it outlined in the March meeting.
![ This chart shows that markets are pricing in 4 Fed rate cuts as of April 17, 2025.

**Stock and bond markets:** So how would markets react under this scenario? While we would not expect a V-shaped recovery from here in markets, we could see stabilization in the months ahead. S&P 500 returns are typically driven by earnings and valuation expansion. In a moderate-tariff scenario, we would expect S&P 500 earnings growth to be revised lower but still remain positive in the low- to mid-single-digit range. If valuations are steady or even contract a bit, this would imply flat returns for the S&P 500, which still is about 10% higher from today's mid-April levels.
We would continue to expect to see diversified portfolios holding up relatively well, with the S&P 500 equal-weight index perhaps outperforming the market-weight index (which remains heavily skewed to growth and tech sectors).
In bonds, we would expect bond yields to remain range-bound, with 10-year Treasury yields in the 4.0% to 4.5% range. We could perhaps see yields approach the lower end of the range as the Fed moves rates lower toward the back half of the year. Nonetheless, with yields still in the 4% range, we continue to see bonds playing an important role in diversified portfolios.
### Scenario 2: Higher tariff rates
There is still a chance that tariff rates remain meaningfully higher in the year ahead, although this is a lower probability outcome in our view. In this scenario, the rates for China would likely remain near peak levels, key sector tariffs remain elevated, and perhaps rates on some trading partners move beyond 10% after the 90-day pause expires. In this case, the average tariff rate in the U.S. moves closer to 25%.
Under this scenario, we would expect a more negative impact across most economic and market variables. Inflation would likely trend toward 5%, while economic growth would likely fall into recession. The Federal Reserve would also be more likely to cut rates sooner and more often, with four or five rate cuts likely.
From a market perspective, given a potential recession in this scenario, we would expect the S&P 500 to likely move back toward a bear market, down 20% or more from recent highs. In addition, bond yields would likely move lower, given a flight-to-safety response in the markets. We would expect 10-year yields to fall below 4.0% in this scenario. Overall, we would expect to see investors gravitate toward defensive positioning in both stock and bond markets.
**Since 1970, S &P 500 returns during a bear market have declined by an average of 39%, typically followed by a period of recovery:**

### Portfolio positioning in times of uncertainty
**Offsetting factors to tariffs**
While uncertainty remains high in the year ahead with elevated tariffs weighing on inflation and growth, keep in mind that there may be some offsetting factors as we head through the year. First, the administration has pointed to tax reform and deregulation as a key part of its agenda. We would expect to see and hear more concrete plans for tax reform, and potentially lower taxes, in the weeks ahead, which would provide fiscal support and improve market sentiment.
Second, we would expect the Federal Reserve to move rates lower over time, providing monetary stimulus to the economy. Lower interest rates would support better borrowing costs for consumers and corporations and help boost spending broadly. Remember that over time corporations can adapt to different operating environments, and sometimes innovation and productivity gains follow.
Overall, while this year may be fraught with tariff and trade volatility, we could potentially be setting up for a better 2026, with incremental fiscal and monetary stimulus supporting economic growth.
**Portfolio positioning – patience and diversification**
While market volatility is never comfortable, it is a normal part of investing. Keep in mind that in any given year, two or three pullbacks are the norm, especially in years with heightened uncertainty. For long-term investors, time in the market has consistently been proven to be a better strategy than trying to time yourself in and out of the market, which can lead to poor investment decisions and lower returns.
Instead, focus on what you can control. Work with a financial advisor to ensure you have appropriate emergency cash on hand. And from a portfolio perspective, consider opportunities to rebalance, diversify, or gradually add quality investments at better prices across asset classes and sectors. Remember that tariff uncertainty over time may shift, and we could see better economic and earnings growth in the year ahead. And over a 10 or 20-year horizon, annualized portfolio gains have a much higher probability of being positive than not.
**For long-term investors, holding stocks and bonds for a longer horizon increases the odds of positive annualized returns:**

Here is the morning Schwab Market Update for Monday, April 21. (Monday market open) A long weekend didn't help Wall Street's mood. Stocks and the dollar tumbled early, still suffering indigestion from worries that President Trump might try to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. That possibility, which the White House floated Friday, might also explain a sharp increase in longer-term U.S. Treasury note yields this morning. If Trump fired Powell, "the market reaction would likely be negative, as the independence of the Fed is highly valued," said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Schwab.
Earnings get heavy this week as investors brace for Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Boeing (BA). With 12% of S&P 500 companies reporting results, 71% have beaten analysts' earnings per share estimates and 61% have reported a positive revenue surprise, FactSet said. The blended EPS growth rate, which includes companies reporting and estimates for those that haven't, is 7.2%. Eyes also turn toward Treasury auctions after recent signs of weaker demand for U.S. assets that rattled markets. And of course, global trade remains front and center after last week saw the S&P 500 index (SPX) fall 1.5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ($COMP) slip 2.6%. The longer it takes for an official trade deal to come together, the worse it is for the economy and the stock market, said Nathan Peterson, director of derivatives analysis at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.
Coming days bring March leading indicators from the Conference Board, new home sales, the Fed's Beige Book on economic conditions around the country, and final April consumer sentiment. Leading indicators is the first of the week's data, due shortly after today's open. It fell 0.3% in February and analysts expect another 0.3% drop in March. Turning to fixed income, a 2-year Treasury note auction tomorrow looms, and could help set direction for yields and stocks.
Three things to watch
1. Stay tuned for tech: Analysts expect 14% first quarter earnings per share (EPS) growth for the info tech sector, according to FactSet. Investors might very well discount strong first quarter numbers as "pull-forward" demand ahead of expected tariffs. Like with home renovation during the early days of the pandemic, that kind of demand doesn't always last and can act as a vampire on future quarters' growth. The vanguard of big tech reporting comes this week when chip makers Intel and Texas Instruments (TXN) share earnings, along with mega cap Alphabet. Though Alphabet is defined as a communication services stock, its cloud business competes with those of tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN)—another non-tech company with a major toehold in tech due to its cloud business. Microsoft, Apple (AAPL), and Meta Platforms (META) release their results next week. Spending trends will be closely watched as worries about slower economic growth could hurt anticipated cloud and digital advertising demand. And a big question is whether recent blockbuster AI spending by so-called hyperscalers might be whittled down in these uncertain times. Such a move might be welcomed by some investors worried about the margin impact of such spending.2. Defensive line: Big military contractors line up to report this week, with Boeing, Northrop Grumman (NOC), and Lockheed Martin (LMT) all due tomorrow and Wednesday. Year to date, NOC is up sharply, LMT is down slightly, and Boeing is off modestly, showing that despite some similarities in their businesses, not all perform the same on Wall Street. Boeing, of course, is burdened by its huge commercial air division, making the comparison a bit unfair. Last week the struggling jet maker took another hit as China banned its airlines from buying Boeing planes. First quarter deliveries for Boeing's Defense, Space & Security division totaled 26, up from 14 during the same quarter a year earlier. On a positive note for all three, President Trump said last week he wants to see the U.S. defense budget reach $1 trillion this year, but on the negative side, U.S. defense partners in Europe, angered by U.S. tariffs, appear eager to invest in manufacturing their own defense technology to reduce reliance on U.S. parts and supplies for weapons, Politico recently reported. German defense stocks suddenly grew popular in investment circles. It might be interesting to check earnings calls from these three mammoth defense firms for any color on initial reactions to tariffs from international customers.
3. Powell talk: The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield, which could move this week on auction news, crept above 4.4% this morning, up 12 basis points from last week's lows, possibly on jitters over Powell's job security. However, Powell has said he wouldn't leave if asked by the president, Politico reported, and that the president has no authority to fire him. Federal law only allows such a move "for cause," according to Politico. Trump's disagreement with Powell over rates apparently wouldn't meet that definition. The dollar hit new three-year lows and gold hit all-time highs this morning while volatility rose, some of this related to trade uncertainty as China warned other countries not to team up with the U.S. against it, but also jitters over Powell's status.
On the move- Eli Lilly (LLY) slipped 0.5% after jumping 14% last Thursday on positive results for its obesity pill. The company's GLP-1 in pill form had similar safety in trials to injectable drugs, Eli Lilly said. A once-a-day pill would add convenience, and Lilly said it will seek approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by later this year for the drug, orforglipron.
- Netflix (NFLX) climbed 1.1% ahead of the open following its earnings report released late Thursday. The streaming company beat earnings per share estimates easily, but revenue was about as expected. It also guided for second quarter revenue and EPS above consensus views and kept full-year guidance.
- Bitcoin (/BTC) surged 2.8% this morning and crypto-connected stock MicroStrategy (MSTR) added 3% despite falling stocks and rising Treasury yields. The Wall Street Journal reported today that several crypto firms plan to apply for bank charters or licenses.
- Tesla, which reports earnings tomorrow, slipped 4% ahead of today's open after Reuters reported that the company aims to delay the U.S. launch of a more affordable Model Y. Tesla also saw its price target lowered by Barclays.
- Nvidia (NVDA) fell 3% ahead of the open, hurt like other semiconductor stocks by continued trade tensions between China and the U.S. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang met with Chinese leaders last week and the Japanese prime minister today, Barron's reported.
- Boeing (BA) fell 1.4% after news that China had returned a Boeing aircraft that had been intended for use by a Chinese airline. This comes after Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145% earlier this month, paralyzing trade relations.
- Hertz (HTZ) fell 10% in pre-market trading, but this came after sharp gains the previous two sessions after Bloomberg reported that Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital had amassed a nearly 20% stake.
- Capital One Financial (COF) rose nearly 5% and Discover Financial Services (DFS) climbed 7% after two top U.S. banking regulators approved Capital One's $35.3 billion all-stock bid to buy Discover, Barron's reported.
- Chances of a May rate cut stood at 10% early today, down from 20% a week ago. June rate cut odds have fallen to 69% from 75% over the last week. Though recent inflation data showed progress, the Fed worries that tariffs could force prices higher. And there's no sign of any cracks in the labor market. Powell isn't scheduled to speak this week, but several other Fed policy makers are, including Vice Chair Philip Jefferson tomorrow.

## Chart of the day

Data sources: FTSE Russell, Nasdaq, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: thinkorswim® platform.
**Past performance is no guarantee of future results.** For illustrative purposes only.
The Russell 2000 ® (RUT—candlesticks) small-cap index eked out slight gains during the shortened week ended last Thursday, coming in ahead of both the S &P 500 Equal Weight Index (SPXEW—purple line) and the Nasdaq-100 ® (NDX—blue line). Though the Russell 2000 has struggled mightily over the last year, down 3.46% during that time period and trailing the other two, it made some decent daily gains last week even as the rest of the market struggled. Though there's no guarantee, small caps are sometimes the first area of the market to see positive activity when there's a turn away from negative sentiment.

Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed-income investments are subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors.
Digital currencies [such as bitcoin] are highly volatile and not backed by any central bank or government. Digital currencies lack many of the regulations and consumer protections that legal-tender currencies and regulated securities have. Due to the high level of risk, investors should view digital currencies as a purely speculative instrument.
Cryptocurrency - related products carry a substantial level of risk and are not suitable for all investors. Investments in cryptocurrencies are relatively new, highly speculative, and may be subject to extreme price volatility, illiquidity, and increased risk of loss, including your entire investment in the fund. Spot markets on which cryptocurrencies trade are relatively new and largely unregulated, and therefore, may be more exposed to fraud and security breaches than established, regulated exchanges for other financial assets or instruments. Some cryptocurrency-related products use futures contracts to attempt to duplicate the performance of an investment in cryptocurrency, which may result in unpredictable pricing, higher transaction costs, and performance that fails to track the price of the reference cryptocurrency as intended.

###  How we make money 
We sell different types of products and services to both investment professionals and individual investors. These products and services are usually sold through license agreements or subscriptions.

###  How we approach editorial content 
Maintaining independence and editorial freedom is essential to our mission of empowering investor success. We provide a platform for our authors to report on investments fairly, accurately, and from the investor’s point of view. We also respect individual opinions––they represent the unvarnished thinking of our people and exacting analysis of our research processes. Our authors can publish views that we may or may not agree with, but they show their work, distinguish facts from opinions, and make sure their analysis is clear and in no way misleading or deceptive. 
To further protect the integrity of our editorial content, we keep a strict separation between our sales teams and authors to remove any pressure or influence on our analyses and research.

**Monday, 04/21/2025 a.m.**
  * **Stocks set to start the week lower as investors await progress on trade negotiations –** Futures point to equity markets opening down around 1% - 2% as trade negotiations between the U.S. and several countries reportedly continue*. In international markets, Asia was mostly higher, as China's central bank held interest rates steady, as expected*. Europe is little changed following the European Central Bank's decision last week to cut its policy rate*. The U.S. dollar is extending its decline against major international currencies. In commodity markets, WTI oil is trading lower as U.S.-Iran talks continue, which could boost supply if sanctions are loosened, while slowing economic growth could reduce demand*. 
  * **Bond yields modestly higher –** Bond yields are up, with the 10-year Treasury yield at 4.40%*. Bond markets are pricing in three or four interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, likely starting in June.** The Fed's own projection for the fed funds rate – known as the "dot plot" – points to two rate cuts this year, which would put the policy rate in the 3.75% - 4.0% range***. We expect the 10-year Treasury to remain primarily in the 4.0% - 4.5% range, as we laid out in our 2025 Outlook. In our view, a positive yield curve should keep intermediate-term Treasury yields above the fed funds rate, which we see heading toward the 3.5% - 4.0% range. The Fed has ended its balance-sheet reduction program – known as "quantitative tightening" – which allows the central bank to participate more actively in Treasury bond auctions, likely helping support bond prices and keeping yields contained to the upside. Persistent government budget deficits and uncertainty relating to inflation could prevent yields from falling much further. 
  * **Markets turn attention to leading economic index –** The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI), which is intended to provide an early indication of significant turning points in the business cycle and where the economy is heading in the near term, will be released this morning. March's reading is expected to tick lower by about 0.5%.* LEI has been trending lower, as Institute for Supply Management (ISM) new orders and consumer expectations for business conditions have been the largest detractors in recent months. Through February, LEI's six-month change, while still negative, remained on its upward trend and does not signal recession risk****. These readings indicate that growth is slowing amid policy uncertainty but do not point to a recession. Pro-growth policies, such as deregulation and tax cuts, should help support the economy later this year, in our view.

###  Thursday, 04/17/2025 p.m.
  * **Stocks finish mixed –** Equity markets were mixed on Thursday, with the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 small-cap index posting modest gains, while the Nasdaq and Dow closed lower. From a leadership perspective, most sectors of the S&P 500 closed higher, led by the energy and consumer staples sectors, while health care and technology were among the laggards. Overseas, markets in Asia traded higher overnight, while European markets were slightly lower following the European Central Bank's decision to lower its policy rate by 0.25% to 2.25% at today's meeting.* Earnings remain in focus, with shares of UnitedHealth Group under pressure today after the company reported first-quarter earnings per share that were lower than expected and also provided lower-than-expected earnings guidance for 2025.* The decline in shares of UnitedHealth weighed on the performance of the Dow, with the index closing lower by roughly 1.3%.* On the economic front, initial jobless claims were lower than expected for last week, while housing starts for March were modestly below expectations.* Bond yields ticked slightly higher, with the 10-year Treasury yield closing around 4.33%.* 
  * **Jobless claims tick lower –** Initial jobless claims for last week were lower than expected, falling to 215,000 from 224,000 in the prior week.* Despite concerns in recent months about layoffs, jobless claims remain well below the 30-year median of 324,000, signaling that layoffs up to this point have been limited.* In addition to low levels of layoffs, job growth has been steady in 2025, with nonfarm payrolls rising by 228,000 in March and averaging 152,000 thus far in 2025. While modestly below the average monthly pace of job gains in 2024 of 168,000, average monthly nonfarm-payroll growth of 152,000 still represents healthy job growth, in our opinion. While labor-market conditions could ease over the coming months as businesses adjust to the new policy backdrop and potentially slowing economic growth, we'd reiterate that the labor market and economy are entering this period of uncertainty from a strong starting point. While downside risks to the economy have certainly risen, a strong starting point could provide support to the U.S. economy. 
  * **Diversification showing its merit in 2025 –** After two consecutive years of outsized returns in U.S. large-cap stocks, international equities have outperformed thus far in 2025, rewarding investors with well-diversified portfolios. International developed large-cap stocks, which include stocks from regions such as Europe and Japan, have been among the top performers, higher by over 6% through yesterday's close, while the S&P 500 is lower by roughly 10%.* Fiscal support out of Germany has provided a boost to sentiment in the region, while a weaker U.S. dollar has supported returns as well.* Emerging-market stocks have also outperformed U.S. equities, and are down only 1% in 2025 through yesterday's close.* In our view, it's too early to call the recent outperformance in international equities the start of a prolonged period of international outperformance versus the U.S., and we believe that opportunities remain attractive in U.S. stocks over a one- to three-year time horizon. However, it does reiterate the value of maintaining a well-diversified portfolio. Incorporating allocations to a variety of asset classes can help smooth periods of volatility and help investors benefit from periods of rotating leadership.

**Wednesday, 04/16/2025 p.m.**
  * **Stocks fall on tech weakness –** U.S. equity markets closed sharply lower on Wednesday, driven by weakness in the technology sector and hawkish-leaning commentary from the Fed. Semiconductor manufacturer NVIDIA announced that it will take a charge of up to $5.5 billion as a result of the U.S. government's decision to impose license requirements for exports to China on its chips.* In response, shares of NVIDIA declined by more than 6%.* Additionally, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell provided an economic outlook speech this afternoon, highlighting that the tariffs announced by the U.S. administration have been much larger than anticipated and will likely lead to slower economic growth and higher price levels in the near term. Chair Powell also reiterated that the Fed will need to ensure that secondary effects of tariffs don't translate into persistently higher inflation, and acknowledged that Fed policy is well-positioned to wait to act until there is more clarity on the policy front. The hawkish-leaning commentary from Fed Chair Powell, along with export restrictions on NVIDIA chips, led to a risk-off move in markets, with the S&P 500 declining by 2.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined by 3.1%.* Overseas, Asian markets were mostly lower overnight, despite a stronger-than-expected first-quarter GDP reading out of China, while European markets traded lower as well. On the economic front, retail sales for March were slightly above expectations, while industrial production was in line with consensus. Bond yields traded lower on Wednesday, with the 10-year Treasury yield declining to 4.28%.* 
  * **All eyes on the consumer** – Consumer-spending trends are in focus today, with retail-sales data for March slightly above expectations. Headline retail sales rose by 1.4% in March, above expectations for a gain of 1.3% and above the February reading of 0.2%.* The higher-than-expected retail sales number was driven by a surge in spending on motor vehicles and parts, which rose by 5.3% in March, perhaps driven by consumers looking to front-run auto tariffs. However, control-group retail sales, which excludes spending on more volatile categories such as gasoline, motor vehicles and building materials, rose by a healthy 0.4%, signaling broad-based strength in spending.* Until March, consumer spending had shown signs of fatigue in the first months of 2025, after growing at an above-trend pace for most of the past two years.* Last Friday's University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey showed that sentiment fell to its lowest since June 2022 in April, as the uncertain policy backdrop has weighed on sentiment.* While consumer spending could soften over the coming months, labor-market conditions and household balance sheets remain healthy, which should prevent any slowdown in spending from turning into a prolonged contraction, in our view. 
  * **Earnings season underway** – First-quarter earnings are underway, with several large U.S. banks, such as J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citibank, having reported earnings thus far. Overall, results have been broadly positive, with strong trading revenue helping the banks exceed analyst expectations. For the quarter, analysts expect S&P 500 earnings per share to grow by 7%, with the technology and health care sectors expected to see the strongest earnings growth.* For the full year, analyst estimates are calling for roughly 10% earnings growth for the S&P 500 in 2025.* In our view, current estimates of 10% earnings growth could prove overly optimistic, as tariffs could potentially have a negative impact on corporate profit margins. However, we still expect earnings growth to remain positive in 2025. The 90-day pause on the April 2 tariff announcement could provide an opportunity for de-escalation and negotiation, which could lead to lower effective tariff rates over time. Corporate earnings could also find support if the tariff backdrop stabilizes and the U.S. administration turns its focus to more pro-growth policies, such as tax reform and deregulation later this year.

###  Tuesday, 04/15/2025 p.m.
  * **Stocks modestly lower as tariff headlines continue** – U.S. markets closed modestly lower on Tuesday, as tariff headlines continue to drive markets. This week, the U.S. administration temporarily paused tariffs on consumer electronics, including smartphones and semiconductors, although it indicated that these will soon be added back to a new category of sector tariffs. In response, China also halted purchases and deliveries of Boeing jets and aircraft equipment from the United States. President Trump also is considering a potential pause on auto tariffs, which boosted the sector yesterday. But again, the administration noted this would be temporary to give carmakers some time to adjust supply chains. Overall, the tariff backdrop remains fluid, and the uncertainty has weighed on financial markets. While stocks had moved higher the past two days, the S&P 500 is down about 8% this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is lower by about 13%*. We would expect volatility to continue, in our view, until a more definitive tariff regime is established, although perhaps peak tariff rates are behind us. 
  * **A reset in stock valuations** – While market returns have been negative this year, the upside is that valuations are now looking more compelling and are no longer stretched, which was a concern coming into this year. All major indexes are trading at or below their 10-year historical forward price-to-earnings multiples, potentially setting the stage for improved long-term returns. The S&P 500 forward multiple is now around 18 times next year's earnings forecast, down from a recent high of 22.7 times, while the Nasdaq forward multiple is about 21 times, down from its recent high of 30 times*. In our view, the spike in volatility, a reset in valuations, and signs that the worst-case scenario in the trade war appears to be averted suggest that stocks may find some support and try to carve out a bottom. Risks have risen, but a recession is not inevitable in our view, and stocks appear to have already priced in a significant degree of bad outcomes. 
  * **Bank earnings surpass expectations** – The first-quarter earnings season officially kicked off last Friday, with bank earnings in focus. Companies like J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citibank have all reported earnings thus far. Overall, the big banks have surpassed earnings expectations, primarily driven by higher trading revenue in equities and fixed income*. While the consumer has been resilient in the first quarter, and credit quality remains healthy, bank executives are pointing to uncertainty in the quarter ahead, given tariff volatility and the potential for higher inflation and slower growth. Capital-markets activity, including IPOs and mergers and acquisitions, has been particularly soft. Overall, we would expect corporate earnings to continue to be revised lower from the current forecasts of around 10% S&P 500 earnings growth. Earnings growth, however, should still be positive this year in our view, especially if the tariff backdrop stabilizes and the administration shifts its focus to tax reform and deregulation.

###  Monday, 04/14/2025 p.m.
  * **Stocks rise on tariff exemption for electronics -** U.S. and global equities finished broadly higher after the Trump administration exempted smartphones, computers, semiconductors, and other electronics from "reciprocal" tariffs. That includes the 125% tariff on China and the 10% baseline tariffs on other countries. President Donald Trump also said he is exploring possible temporary exemptions on imported vehicles and parts to give auto companies more time to set up domestic manufacturing. Small- and mid-caps outperformed, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq also rose on the news. However, optimism was contained by Commerce Secretary Lutnick's comments that the exemptions are temporary, as electronics will be covered by a separate sectoral tariff framework on semiconductors, which is expected to be announced in the next one to two months. Nonetheless, the news offered a welcomed reprieve to the escalating trade war. Additional support today came from signs of stabilization in the bond market, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 4.38% after an unexpected rise to 4.50% last week*. 
  * **Tariff pause may help ease volatility -** With U.S. stocks on the verge of entering a bear market, the U.S. administration softened its approach last week, announcing a 90-day delay on the implementation of the "reciprocal" tariffs, with the exception of China. The pause provides time for negotiations, potentially allowing countries to strike deals. Perhaps peak trade uncertainty is now behind us, even though businesses and investors are unlikely to get the clarity they seek right away. Negotiations will kick into high gear, but that process may take a while, and, in the meantime, there will likely be a mix of positive and negative headlines keeping volatility elevated. However, with volatility jumping last week to near historic extremes, there is more room for it to fall than rise. History also shows that fear creates opportunities for those that follow a disciplined and patient approach. Once the VIX, also known as the fear index, has exceeded 43 (it reached a high of 52 on 4/8/25), forward six- and 12-month equity-market returns have been strong*. 
  * **Earnings next in focus -** In a holiday-shortened week in honor of Good Friday, investors will be paying close attention to corporate updates, as the first-quarter earnings season kicks into higher gear. With tariff risks looming, analysts have started to revise earnings estimates lower, but positive growth is still expected. The estimated earnings growth rate for the quarter is 7.3%, down from 18.2% in the fourth quarter of 2024, with seven of the 11 sectors expected to deliver positive earnings growth*. Health care and technology are expected to experience the fastest earnings growth, while energy and materials are likely to see the largest earnings decline. For the full year, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow 10%*. As economic growth slows this year, we think that further downward revisions are likely. However, the upside of this down market is that valuations are now looking more compelling and are no longer stretched, which was a concern coming into this year. All major indexes are trading at or below their 10-year historical averages, potentially setting the stage for improved long-term returns*.

###  Friday, 04/11/2025 p.m.
  * **Stocks rise on Friday to close out a volatile week –** Equity markets were up on Friday, as earnings season kicks off, with materials and technology stocks posting the largest gains. The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index, released this morning, fell for the fourth consecutive month in April to 50.8, missing forecasts of a smaller drop to 54.0.* The survey shows the impact of tariffs on consumer confidence, with expectations for inflation over the next 12 months rising to 6.7%, up from 5.0% in March.** While these readings could begin to affect consumer spending, they do not reflect the 90-day pause in new tariffs by President Trump, which could have a positive impact on surveys over the coming months. In international markets, Asia was mixed, as China raised its tariffs on imports from the U.S. to 125%, while Europe was down modestly.* Bond yields rose, with the 10-year Treasury yield at 4.49%. The U.S. dollar declined against major international currencies. In commodity markets, WTI oil traded higher following its steep decline in recent weeks*. 
  * **Corporate earnings season off to a solid start –** First-quarter earnings season kicked off this week, with the largest banks leading the way. J.P. Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley each reported earnings that exceeded estimates. While forecasts for first-quarter earnings growth of S&P 500 companies have been revised lower to 6.4%, performance is expected to be broad, with seven of the 11 sectors forecast to report higher earnings year-over-year*. Wider earnings growth should drive more balanced market performance across sectors, strengthening the case for portfolio diversification, in our view. In addition, earnings growth is expected to accelerate over the quarters ahead to 10.5% for 2025,* which should provide solid fundamentals to support stock prices over time, in our view. 
  * **Producer price inflation lower than expected –** Producer price index (PPI) inflation fell to 2.7% annualized in March, well below estimates calling for a modest increase to 3.3%*. Energy prices were a key contributor to the drop in headline wholesale inflation, down 4.0% month-over-month***. Core PPI inflation, which excludes more-volatile food and energy prices, declined to 3.3% on a year-over-year basis, compared with forecasts for 3.6%*. We believe these readings, though likely not meaningfully impacted by tariffs, indicate that inflation continues to moderate. We expect tariffs to put some upward pressure on inflation, as higher import costs are at least partially passed along to consumers. However, most of this impact should be near-term price hikes that aren't an ongoing driver of inflation, in our view.

The signs of a bear market 
[ Stock market decline: The signs of a bear market 01:28 ]
Stocks gave up a big gain from earlier in the day Monday and closed down Monday afternoon as Wall Street's recent bout of volatility continued.
After adding more than 200 points earlier in the session, the Dow fell 245 points, or 1 percent, to close at 24,442. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq also sagged, with technology and communications companies posting some of the biggest losses.
Stocks have plunged since early October, and trading has been especially volatile the last few days. The S&P 500 is down 9 percent this month, which would be its worst monthly loss since February 2009, shortly before the market bottomed during the financial crisis.
Shares of Red Hat, an open-source software company, soared 45 percent to $169.56 after IBM announced plans to buy it for $34 billion. IBM said the purchase, its biggest deal ever, will help the company take the next step in cloud computing. Chairman and CEO Ginni Rometty said the deal will make IBM the world's biggest hybrid cloud provider, meaning it will offer companies a mix of on-site, private and third-party public cloud services. IBM fell 4.8 percent to $118.77.
Earlier on Monday, stocks in Europe also turned sharply higher. Italy's main stock index rallied after Standard & Poor's did not lower the country's credit rating. 
German stocks rose even though longtime German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she won't run for another term in 2021. She has been chancellor of Germany for 18 years. The Bovespa in Brazil climbed after far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro was elected president.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.10 percent from 3.07 percent.
