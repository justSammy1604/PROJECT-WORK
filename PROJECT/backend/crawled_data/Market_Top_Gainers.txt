  * GTCR set to reap handsome windfall from Worldpay's $24.25 billion sale Private equity firm GTCR is poised to garner a return of about two times its investment in Worldpay, after the sale of its 55% stake in the payments processor to Global Payments, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Such a big windfall has become increasingly rare in the private equity industry, which has been starved of large exits during the last two years when high interest rates froze up financing markets and slowed down the pace of large leveraged buyouts. Earlier on Thursday, Global Payments agreed to buy Worldpay for around $24.25 billion and divest its issuer services unit for $13.5 billion in a complex three-way deal, marking one of the biggest transactions in the payments industry in recent years.

Securities trading is offered to self-directed customers by Webull Financial LLC, a broker dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Webull Financial LLC is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ([FINRA]), Securities Investor Protection Corporation ([SIPC]), The New York Stock Exchange ([NYSE]), [NASDAQ] and Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc ([CBOE EDGX]).
Webull Financial LLC is a CFTC registered Futures Commission Merchant with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and a Member of the National Futures Association ([NFA]). Futures and futures options trading involves substantial risk and is not suitable for all investors. Please read the Risk Disclosure Statement and other relevant Futures Disclosures located at [www.webull.com/fcm-disclosures] prior to trading futures products. Futures accounts are not protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).
Advisory accounts and services are provided by Webull Advisors LLC (also known as "Webull Advisors"). Webull Advisors is an Investment Advisor registered with and regulated by the SEC under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. Registration does not imply a level of skill or training. See additional information on the Disclosures webpage. Trades in your Webull Advisors account are executed by Webull Financial LLC.
Account Protection: SIPC and Excess SIPC Coverage Client securities accounts at Webull Financial LLC are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC") for a maximum coverage of $500,000 (with a cash sublimit of $250,000). In addition, Webull offers clients Excess SIPC coverage based on the clearing arrangement: For securities accounts under the omnibus clearing relationship with Apex, Webull carries an excess SIPC policy with certain underwriters at Lloyd's of London, which extends per account coverage for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $100 million, subject to a maximum limit of $1,900,000 for any one customer’s cash. Securities positions are not subject to any per account sublimit. (ii) For securities accounts that are fully-disclosed to the clearing firm, Apex has purchased an additional insurance policy. The coverage limits provide protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million, subject to maximum limits of $37.5 million for any one customer's securities and $900,000 for any one customer's cash. For the purpose of determining a Webull Financial LLC covered account, accounts with like names and titles are combined, but accounts with different titles are not (e.g. Individual/John Doe and IRA/John Doe). Futures and other assets held outside the securities account are not covered. SIPC and Excess SIPC Protections do not protect against a loss in the market value of securities. SIPC is a non-profit, membership corporation funded by broker-dealers that are members of SIPC. For more information about SIPC and answers to frequently asked questions please refer to the following websites: (i) <http://www.SIPC.org> (ii) <https://www.finra.org/investors/have-problem/your-rights-under-sipc-protection=>
Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors. Option investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date. Losses can potentially exceed the initial required deposit. You need to complete an options trading application and get approval on eligible accounts. Please read the [Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options] before trading options.
All investments involve risk, and not all risks are suitable for every investor. The value of securities may fluctuate and as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment. The past performance of a security, or financial product does not guarantee future results or returns. Keep in mind that while diversification may help spread risk, it does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a down market. There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities or other financial products. Investors should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before investing.
Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses. Margin trading increases risk of loss and includes the possibility of a forced sale if account equity drops below required levels. Margin is not available in all account types. Margin trading privileges are subject to Webull Financial, LLC review and approval. Leverage carries a high level of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Greater leverage creates greater losses in the event of adverse market movements.
Investors should be aware that system response, execution price, speed, liquidity, market data, and account access times are affected by many factors, including market volatility, size and type of order, market conditions, system performance, and other factors. Market volatility, volume and system availability may delay account access and trade executions.
Free trading of stocks, ETFs, and options refers to $0 commissions for Webull Financial LLC self-directed individual cash or margin brokerage accounts and IRAs that trade U.S. listed securities via mobile devices, desktop or website products. A $0.55 per contract fee applies for certain index options and a $0.10 per contract fee applies for oversized option orders. Relevant regulatory and exchange fees may apply. Please refer to our [Fee Schedule] for more details.
No content on the Webull Financial LLC website shall be considered as a recommendation or solicitation for the purchase or sale of securities, options, or other investment products.

Transparency is our policy. Learn how it impacts everything we do  Read More 
Transparency is how we protect the integrity of our work and keep empowering investors to achieve their goals and dreams. And we have unwavering standards for how we keep that integrity intact, from our research and data to our policies on content and your personal data. 
We’d like to share more about how we work and what drives our day-to-day business.
![](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt3bce7cffbeb60a42/60809fdf26fd84453c018424/make-money.svg)
###  How we make money 
We sell different types of products and services to both investment professionals and individual investors. These products and services are usually sold through license agreements or subscriptions. Our investment management business generates asset-based fees, which are calculated as a percentage of assets under management. We also sell both admissions and sponsorship packages for our investment conferences and advertising on our websites and newsletters.

###  How we use your personal data 
How we use your information depends on the product and service that you use and your relationship with us. We may use it to:
  * Verify your identity, personalize the content you receive, or create and administer your account.
  * Provide specific products and services to you, such as portfolio management or data aggregation.
  * Develop and improve features of our offerings.
  * Gear advertisements and other marketing efforts towards your interests.

###  How we approach editorial content 
Maintaining independence and editorial freedom is essential to our mission of empowering investor success. We provide a platform for our authors to report on investments fairly, accurately, and from the investor’s point of view. We also respect individual opinions––they represent the unvarnished thinking of our people and exacting analysis of our research processes. Our authors can publish views that we may or may not agree with, but they show their work, distinguish facts from opinions, and make sure their analysis is clear and in no way misleading or deceptive. 
To further protect the integrity of our editorial content, we keep a strict separation between our sales teams and authors to remove any pressure or influence on our analyses and research. 
Read our [editorial policy] to learn more about our process.
