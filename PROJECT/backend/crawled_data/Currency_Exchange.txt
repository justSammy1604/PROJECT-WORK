## Make the world a smaller place
From foreign currency exchange to international wire transfers, we can help

##  Traveling internationally or need to send an international wire transfer? Wells Fargo’s foreign exchange has got you covered. 
![](https://www17.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/images/photography/lifestyle/462x263-fx-cash.jpg)
## Foreign currency cash
As you start your trip, having local currency on hand lets you easily cover immediate expenses without needing to hunt down a currency exchange office. On your return, we can often buy back unused foreign currency cash at a Wells Fargo branch.
We offer more than 70 currencies available for use in over 100 countries.
**Note:** Our branches no longer have foreign currency cash on-hand available for over-the-counter same-day purchase, and we no longer can take foreign currency cash orders over the phone. 
Wells Fargo account holders can order foreign currency cash online, or at a branch, and have delivery within 2-7 business days.
We do not buy back all currencies, and buy-back rates differ from rates for ordering cash. We do not buy back coins. Foreign currency cash is intended for travel-related purposes only. Wells Fargo does not recommend foreign currency cash as an investment product.

## International wire services
Use our international wire transfer services to send and receive overseas payments.
Whether online, via the mobile app, or in-person [at a branch], Wells Fargo offers a number of ways to send international wire transfers.
Sending an international wire transfer in foreign currency lets you lock in an exchange rate up front and know the exact amount of foreign currency being sent to the beneficiary.
In addition to assisting you with sending foreign currency wires, Wells Fargo can also receive wires denominated in many foreign currencies.

### FAQs
Why are RBC rates different from those quoted in the media and online? 
Exchange rates quoted in the media are the exchange rates, used by banks and other market participants to buy and sell currencies in the wholesale market. Client transactions require additional processing and are usually for much smaller amounts, and as a result, are priced using a retail rate.
Why are RBC rates for cash conversion different than non-cash rates? 
Exchange rates applied to cash transactions include shipping and handling charges, making the exchange rate for cash less favorable than the non-cash rate. Non-cash rates are applied to paper instruments such as cheques and drafts. Non-cash rates are also applied to incoming and outgoing wire payments and other electronic transactions. These instruments do not require physical storage or movement, and incur less time and cost for processing than cash transactions. Therefore a more favorable rate is applied to non-cash instruments.
Why should I convert my Canadian dollars to a foreign currency in Canada, before travelling to other countries? 
It is often more beneficial to convert your Canadian dollars to the local currency of your travel destination before you leave Canada. Many banks, foreign exchange kiosks and hotels in other countries charge commission or service charges in addition to exchange rates that are often higher than those in Canada when converting your Canadian dollars to their local currency.

The result of the calculation is intended to be a general guide to historical values, rather than a categorical statement of fact. 
Sorry, you do not have JavaScript enabled which is required for the currency converter at the moment.
## Disclaimer
The data used in this currency converter comes from our historical records such as those of the royal household and Exchequer. These documents may record large purchases by government institutions rather than ordinary retail prices, and wages of skilled craftsmen rather than the general level of earnings. Our calculations are intended as a general guide to historical values, not a statement of fact. There are no plans to update the calculator for values beyond 2017.
You can find an inflation calculator at [www.bankofengland.co.uk], and comparators (for the UK and various other countries) at [measuringworth.com].
Calculations based on the retail price index may not always be appropriate: comparisons based on average earnings or gross domestic product per head may be more suitable. You can find comparators of both kinds at [measuringworth.com], along with explanations of each type of calculation and of the sources on which they are based.
