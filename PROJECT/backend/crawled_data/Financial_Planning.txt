• [ Mom paying $41,357 a year in premiums for Whole Life Insurance, is it a scam or bad move from her? ] [ Hi guys,  Just recently found out my mom has been paying $41,357 (USD) per annum (for 3 years straight) for Whole Life Insurance from Transamerica Life Bermuda.  I can't seem to find any information or reviews online.. can't help to think she's wasting her money away but not sure what to tell her to dissuade her from going any further with this.  I live in Australia if it helps..  Someone help me understand... I feel angry and honestly helpless  ]

What is FP&A?
![](https://www.sap.com/etc.clientlibs/sapdx/front-layer/dist/resources/assets/images/BackgroundPlaceholder.svg)
# What is financial planning and analysis (FP&A)?
FP&A is a set of planning, forecasting, budgeting, and analytical activities that support business decisions and financial health.
[Explore FP&A software]
## Financial planning and analysis overview
To compete and thrive in today’s business world, you must be able to pivot quickly – and develop a streamlined and resilient business strategy. Financial planning analysts and professionals are being asked to see around corners and to provide accurate, data-driven insights to help inform confident planning and decision-making across the entire enterprise.
## FP&A meaning and definition
Financial planning and analysis (FP&A) is a set of planning, forecasting, budgeting, and analytical activities that support a company’s major business decisions and overall financial health. With a corporate [FP&A software], finance teams can combine financial data, operational data, and external data (like market trends) in one place. Finance can analyze it all – and uncover the in-depth insights they need to plan for the future and guide more profitable decision-making.
[![placeholder](https://www.sap.com/products/financial-management/what-is-financial-planning-and-analysis-fpa.html)]
This video explains the meaning and significance of financial planning and analysis (FP&A) in the modern business landscape.
FP&A tools can help finance professionals:
  * Provide fast and accurate financial analysis and advice to business leaders
  * Predict the impact of potential decisions on cash flow and profitability
  * Assess and monitor the company’s overall financial health and investments
  * Build and maintain detailed financial models and forecasts
  * Create agile, integrated financial plans that account for multiple scenarios
  * Collaborate with departments to prepare and consolidate budgets
  * Align corporate strategy with execution and track performance
  * Identify and assess new revenue opportunities and risk
  * And much more


Financial planning and analysis is typically part of a broader financial management system – which also includes functionality for accounting, revenue and cash flow management, [governance, risk, and compliance (GRC)], and other core financial processes. Alternatively, FP&A can be part of a standalone analytics solution that integrates with other business systems, like [ERP]. Either way, FP&A has grown from basic spreadsheets and manual calculations into modern, cloud-based solutions that use [artificial intelligence (AI)].The Importance of Financial Planning | Charles Schwab

# High School Financial Planning Program
NEFE’s flagship High School Financial Planning Program (HSFPP) promoted sound and informed financial education to teachers and students from the time it was launch in 1984. Built on performance competencies that were independently evaluated to improve financial knowledge, behavior and confidence in students, this award-winning, noncommercial program included free classroom materials and lesson plans.
NEFE officially retired HSFPP on July 31, 2021.

## HSFPP Evaluation
### HSFPP Positively Impacts Teen Confidence and Behavior
Periodically, the HSFPP commissions third-party evaluators to assess how well its curriculum is meeting the needs of teachers and students. The Economics Center at the University of Cincinnati conducted the latest evaluation over the 2016-2017 school year.
In addition to assessing the HSFPP, this evaluation is a snapshot of teen financial education as a whole—and offers insight into how schools can create the ideal climate for improving students’ financial capability.
### Key Findings
This evaluation confirms that financial education increases teens’ confidence, knowledge and skills. Whether it is the HSFPP or another program, positive gains in financial education appear to be linked[Skip to main content](<#main>)
