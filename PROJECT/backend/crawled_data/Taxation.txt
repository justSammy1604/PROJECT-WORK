#  How to pay and get help with state and local taxes
In many states, counties, and cities, you may have to pay taxes on income, property, and what you buy. Learn more about state taxes and who to contact if you need help. 
## **Learn what state and local taxes you may have to pay**
  * **Income tax** - The amount of state and local income tax you pay will depend on how much income you earn and the tax rate of the state or locality where you live. Currently, 41 states collect income tax on salary and wages.
  * **Personal property tax** - You may have to pay taxes based on the value of your personal property. Personal property can include cars, boats, recreation vehicles, and business machinery. Not all states or local jurisdictions collect personal property taxes.
  * **Real estate tax** - In most cases, you will pay your real estate tax to your local government instead of your state government. Your local government’s tax office assesses the value of your home, and the amount you pay can depend on your home’s market value, location, and condition.
  * **Sales tax** - The sales tax you pay is based on a percentage of the sales price of an item you buy. Most states and municipalities have a sales tax and charge different percentages on different goods, or not at all for other items.


## **Pay or get help with your state and local taxes**

# Tax 101: Understanding the basics

#### By [The Currency editors]
12.13.2024 
For many Americans, filing income tax returns and paying taxes is a part of life. There is a reason, after all, that there is the existence of the phrase, “In this world, nothing is certain, except death and taxes.” In 2023, the IRS received 162,037,0001 individual income tax returns and issued $335 billion in refunds. As income tax season comes around again, you might be wondering how taxes work and which taxes you are responsible for paying.
For a lot of people, when they hear the word “taxes”, it’s income tax that immediately comes to mind. However, there are several other types of taxes that are assessed and paid over the course of a year and your lifetime. When you stop to really think about it, you might be surprised to find how many types of taxes you have the potential of being subject to over the course of time.
With that in mind, understanding the tax system and its potential cost can be very important to help individuals and businesses navigate their financial strategies to minimize the overall impact of taxes. An important part of long-term financial success lies in being efficient with your money to minimize taxes to the greatest extent legally possible.
## What are taxes?
Simply put, taxes are the sum of money paid to the government to collectively fund spending towards public goods and services. Taxes are used to fund things like schools, roads, and various public programs, such as Social Security and Medicare.
