Summary: As an Asset Management Research Associate at Oppenheimer & Co., I am responsible for the due diligence research of selected investment managers on our service platform and for the curation of our firm’s investment manager Focus List. I participate and lead quarterly performance calls and bi-annual reviews of our investment managers and support our firm’s financial advisors in the selection of and allocation to investment managers across a variety of asset classes. Since graduation, I have chosen to pursue both the Certified Financial Planning™ and Charter Financial Analyst designations. I passed the CFP® exam in March 2022 and the CFA Level III exam in February 2024, carrying both designations today. I graduated as Valedictorian from Manhattanville College with Honors in Finance and Economics and with two distinguished academic recognitions: the O’Byrne Award, for highest overall GPA, and the Rindlaub Scholarship, for considerable academic achievement in the fields of Finance and Economics. Moreover, I was granted the Chairperson’s Scholarship, which honors students that demonstrated academic excellence in both pre-university and undergraduate education. While at university, I was also a member of the Men’s Ice Hockey Team, and I captained the team in my junior and senior seasons. In my sophomore season, our team won the first league championship and earned the first NCAA Championship Playoff berth in nearly a decade for our school. We proceeded to finish in the final 8 of the NCAA Division III tournament. In addition to our team accomplishments, I was nominated in 6 of 8 semesters as an ACHA All American Scholar Athlete. Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I enjoy weightlifting, running, golfing, reading, and socializing with friends and family. I have run two half-marathons and am currently training for my first full marathon later in 2024, for which I am targeting a time of sub 3-hours in order to qualify for the 2025 Boston Marathon. I am also a self-taught guitar player and continue to develop my skills on both the acoustic and electric guitar.
