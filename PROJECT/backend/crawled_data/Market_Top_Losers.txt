### [How China's 'monster market' could impact US Big Tech China could make life harder for US Big Tech companies like Tesla (TSLA) and Apple (AAPL), but it lacks the direct leverage the US holds. Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explains how China might still push for a deal with the US.

### [Tesla must do these 3 on its earnings call, or else You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. With all due respect to JPMorgan (JPM) and Netflix (NFLX), the most important earnings report of the early earnings season will come on Tuesday by way of embattled Tesla (TSLA). The EV maker’s stock has been run over since President Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration day, plunging 43%. It’s not hard to find reasons for the tanking. The public’s rebuke of DOGE master and Trump supporter Elon Musk has translated into falling sales. Meanwhile, Trump’s 145% tariffs on China risk Tesla getting the parts it needs to profitably grow a business like the Cybercab while also operating successfully in the country. “The turnaround vision must start this Tuesday night on the earnings conference call for Musk and Tesla,” tech analyst Dan Ives says. Here are three things that Musk must do on the earnings call to begin rebuilding investors' sentiment in the stock: Government exit timeline: Musk must tell investors when he plans to exit his DOGE role and get back to 100% focus on Tesla. Tariff impact: Musk (or other execs on the earnings call) must clearly quantify the financial impact of Trump’s tariffs on Tesla’s business. Turning Tesla around: Musk must articulate the turnaround plan for Tesla. Whether he likes it not, Tesla is now a turnaround story in the eyes of investors. The company may not be bloated cost-wise like typical turnarounds, but Musk has a lot to fix to get the top line back on track.

Disclaimer: The TipRanks Smart Score performance is based on backtested results. Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account. No cash balance or cash flow is included in the calculation.

## **What are Top Losers?**
Top losers in stocks are the ones that have dropped the most in price compared to their previous closing price. This means these stocks are currently selling for much less than they were before. Investors keep an eye on top losers to understand market trends and possibly find buying opportunities when they [invest in US Stocks](https://www.indmoney.com/us-stocks/<https:/www.indmoney.com/us-stocks>).
## Strategies to Manage Risk
Managing risk is key to protecting your money in the stock market. Here’s how to keep your investments safer:
  * Diversify Your Portfolio:
Don't put all your money in one stock or sector. Spread it out to reduce risk.
  * Set Stop-Loss Orders:
Decide on a price at which you'll sell a stock to avoid bigger losses.
  * Understand What You're Investing In:
Know the businesses behind your stocks to make informed decisions.
  * Keep an Eye on Market Trends:
Stay updated with market news that could affect your stocks.
  * Invest for the Long Term:
Holding stocks for longer can smooth out the ups and downs.
  * Regularly Review Your Portfolio:
Check your investments regularly to make sure they still meet your goals and risk tolerance.


## Signs a Top Losing Stock Can Recover
  * Past Performance:
Look at the stock's history. Stocks that have bounced back from declines before may have a good structure in place for recovery.
  * Strong Fundamentals:
Investigate the company's fundamentals, like earnings, debt levels, and cash flow. Strong fundamentals can signal a potential for recovery.
  * Industry Trends:
Consider whether the industry the company operates in is growing or expected to grow. Stocks in growing industries have better chances of recovery.
  * Market Position:
Companies that hold a strong market position or unique advantage in their industry are more likely to recover from downturns.
  * Management Response:
Pay attention to how the company's management plans to address the issues that led to the stock's decline. Effective strategies can lead to recovery.
  * External Factors: 
Sometimes, external factors like economic changes or industry shifts cause stock declines. If these factors are temporary, the stock might have a good chance to rebound.


## Should You Invest in a Top Loser
Investing in a top loser can be risky, but it might also offer a unique opportunity for growth. Here's what you need to consider:
  * Risk vs. Reward:
Understand that investing in a top loser involves higher risk. The potential for high rewards exists, but so does the possibility of further losses.
  * Research is Key:
Thoroughly research the company's fundamentals, including its financial health, industry position, and growth potential. Don't invest based on price drops alone.
  * Market Trends:
Analyze whether the stock's decline is due to broader market trends or company-specific issues. Stocks affected by temporary market dips may offer good value.
  * Time Horizon:
Be prepared to invest for the long term. Recovery may not happen quickly, and patience is crucial when investing in stocks that have recently declined significantly. 
  * Diversification:
If you decide to invest in a top loser, ensure it's part of a diversified portfolio to mitigate risk. Never put all your eggs in one basket, especially a risky one.
  * Exit Strategy:
Have a clear exit strategy in place. Decide in advance the conditions under which you would sell, whether to cut losses or take profits, to avoid emotional decision-making.


## Frequently Asked Questions
### What makes a stock a "top loser"?
A "top loser" is a stock that has seen the largest drop in its price over a specific period, typically a day. This could be due to various reasons like poor earnings reports, negative news, or broader market declines.
### Can top losers be a good investment?
Yes, sometimes. If the company has strong fundamentals and the price drop seems temporary, it might recover and offer high returns. However, it's important to research thoroughly before investing.
### Is it risky to invest in top losers?
Yes, investing in top losers can be riskier than choosing stocks with steady performance. The potential for gains is higher, but so is the potential for losses. Diversification and research are crucial.

To further protect the integrity of our editorial content, we keep a strict separation between our sales teams and authors to remove any pressure or influence on our analyses and research.

### Top Losers on High Volume Frequently Asked Questions
####  What is a top stock loser on big volume? 
Top losers are stocks that are showing a big percentage decline in their share value for the day. The high volume indicates that there is a lot more trading going on than usual. This can point to something important happening in the stock. We look for volume that is at least 2 times greater than the average daily volume over the last 90 days. 
####  How can top losers on high volume be used by traders? 
Increased volatility along with high volume can present trading opportunities. Traders will frequently search for stocks that are experiencing large price fluctuations to capitalize on short term moves until the stock finds its equilibrium. Violent moves in stock price can cause the stock to overshoot and bounce around until it finds its new fair value. Traders will research the news behind the move and combine technical and fundamental analysis to trade around their price targets and trading models.

Securities trading is offered to self-directed customers by Webull Financial LLC, a broker dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Webull Financial LLC is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ and Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc (CBOE EDGX).
Webull Financial LLC is a CFTC registered Futures Commission Merchant with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and a Member of the National Futures Association (NFA). Futures and futures options trading involves substantial risk and is not suitable for all investors. Please read the Risk Disclosure Statement and other relevant Futures Disclosures located at www.webull.com/fcm-disclosures prior to trading futures products. Futures accounts are not protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).
Advisory accounts and services are provided by Webull Advisors LLC (also known as "Webull Advisors"). Webull Advisors is an Investment Advisor registered with and regulated by the SEC under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. Registration does not imply a level of skill or training. See additional information on the Disclosures webpage. Trades in your Webull Advisors account are executed by Webull Financial LLC.
Account Protection: SIPC and Excess SIPC Coverage Client securities accounts at Webull Financial LLC are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC") for a maximum coverage of $500,000 (with a cash sublimit of $250,000). In addition, Webull offers clients Excess SIPC coverage based on the clearing arrangement: For securities accounts under the omnibus clearing relationship with Apex, Webull carries an excess SIPC policy with certain underwriters at Lloyd's of London, which extends per account coverage for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $100 million, subject to a maximum limit of $1,900,000 for any one customer’s cash. Securities positions are not subject to any per account sublimit. (ii) For securities accounts that are fully-disclosed to the clearing firm, Apex has purchased an additional insurance policy. The coverage limits provide protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million, subject to maximum limits of $37.5 million for any one customer's securities and $900,000 for any one customer's cash. For the purpose of determining a Webull Financial LLC covered account, accounts with like names and titles are combined, but accounts with different titles are not (e.g. Individual/John Doe and IRA/John Doe). Futures and other assets held outside the securities account are not covered. SIPC and Excess SIPC Protections do not protect against a loss in the market value of securities. SIPC is a non-profit, membership corporation funded by broker-dealers that are members of SIPC. For more information about SIPC and answers to frequently asked questions please refer to the following websites: (i) http://www.SIPC.org (ii) https://www.finra.org/investors/have-problem/your-rights-under-sipc-protection=>
Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors. Option investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date. Losses can potentially exceed the initial required deposit. You need to complete an options trading application and get approval on eligible accounts. Please read the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options before trading options.
All investments involve risk, and not all risks are suitable for every investor. The value of securities may fluctuate and as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment. The past performance of a security, or financial product does not guarantee future results or returns. Keep in mind that while diversification may help spread risk, it does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a down market. There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities or other financial products. Investors should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before investing.
Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses. Margin trading increases risk of loss and includes the possibility of a forced sale if account equity drops below required levels. Margin is not available in all account types. Margin trading privileges are subject to Webull Financial, LLC review and approval. Leverage carries a high level of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Greater leverage creates greater losses in the event of adverse market movements.
Investors should be aware that system response, execution price, speed, liquidity, market data, and account access times are affected by many factors, including market volatility, size and type of order, market conditions, system performance, and other factors. Market volatility, volume and system availability may delay account access and trade executions.
Free trading of stocks, ETFs, and options refers to $0 commissions for Webull Financial LLC self-directed individual cash or margin brokerage accounts and IRAs that trade U.S. listed securities via mobile devices, desktop or website products. A $0.55 per contract fee applies for certain index options and a $0.10 per contract fee applies for oversized option orders. Relevant regulatory and exchange fees may apply. Please refer to our Fee Schedule for more details.
No content on the Webull Financial LLC website shall be considered as a recommendation or solicitation for the purchase or sale of securities, options, or other investment products. All information and data on the website is for reference only and no historical data shall be considered as the basis for judging future trends.
