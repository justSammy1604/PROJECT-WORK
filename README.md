#### IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT  
We'll start implementing the project on the 6th if that's alright with everyone 

We'll follow the flowchart that we showed during our review.
For now, we'll create a RAG chatbot with a few additional features of our own that include:
- Joseph's method of using NLP to extract keywords and based on that generate the possible output.
- Use a web crawler for data, that is done by Terrence.

I have already created the respective files to work on, so fork the repos and work on the respective folders assigned to you.
- `Christie` and `Mathias` y'all can work on the frontend. Lemme know which technology y'all will be using for the frontend.
- `Joseph`, `Terrence` and I will work on backend. Y'all lemme know which model, vector db and embedding y'all would prefer.
- I may alternate `Terrence` on both sides if frontend peeps need any help.

I will add a flowchart here today. 

And we'll discuss the entire codebase with everyone so that everyone knows what everyone is doing. 

And create PRs and report them on the group.
