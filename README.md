#### IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT 
We'll start implementing the project on the 6th if that's alright with everyone

We'll follow the flowchart that we showed during our review.
For now, we'll create a RAG chatbot with a few additional features of our own that include:
- Joseph's method of using NLP to extract keywords and based on that generate the possible output.
- Use a web crawler for data, that is done by Terrence.

I have already created the respective files to work on, so fork the repos and work on that folder.
`Christie` and `Mathias` y'all can work on the frontend. Lemme know which technology y'all will be using for the frontend.
